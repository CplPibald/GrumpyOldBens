Apple AirDrop, and "bluejacking" - Security hole in contacts mode
    https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2021/04/23/apple-airdrop-has-significant-privacy-leak-say-german-researchers/
    AirDrop = proprietary Apple p2p for sending files
        Someone wants to send file, chooses a nearby phone
        A preview of the file (image) pops up and the phone asks if you want to receive it
        AirDrop can be in Everyone mode or Contacts mode
    in Everyone mode, you get dick pics walking through an airport
    in Contacts mode, the phones swap contacts to decide whether it can be sent
        Each contact is hashed using SHA-256, and the lists of hashes are exchanged
            but no salt
        So it's possible with a few Gb of space eg: to build a reverse lookup table of all 10M numbers in an area code
            or 1B UK numbers, even all 10B US/Canada phone numbers
    Connection handshake should keep it private, but in testing, researchers found that they could
        record the handshake if they could jam the connection often enough to get people to "try everyone mode"

"bluejacking"
    https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2017/08/17/woman-targeted-with-120-images-on-public-transport-via-airdrop/
    first started in 2003 when phones came out with BT
    by crafting a vCard whose "name" is the message you want to send
        A popup appears with the name of the contact asking if you want to add the card
            eg: "I would like to rub against you [Y/N]"
    Story is about a HuffPo writer who received 150 dick pics while traveling the London Underground
        article "Stop telling me to turn my AirDrop off" because they'll just dickpic someone else
        Dr Justin Lehmiller, a Harvard University psychology professor
            says "the (extremely) common phenomenon of sending unwanted penis pictures to women could be attributed 
                to cognitive biases that have evolved to help with reproduction."
            "I suspect that the most likely explanation is that men are simply misperceiving women’s interest in 
                receiving photos of their junk. There’s a large body of research indicating that men aren’t very good 
                at determining how interested women are in sex."

WhatsApp doesn't let you appear offline
    https://traced.app/2021/04/13/whatsapp-status-loophole-is-aiding-cyberstalkers/
    boon to cyberstalkers
    discord, steam, linkedin, reddit, even github tell others if you're online
    story about online status in MS Lync
    there exist WhatsApp status tracker apps, which will compare daily online times over the last few weeks to show patterns
        and even compare it against another number
        see if two people are contacting each other (the "cheating spouse" problem)
