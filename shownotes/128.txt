Harvard students petition university to revoke degrees of Trump supporters
    https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/harvard-students-seek-to-revoke-diplomas-of-trump-supporting-graduates-following-capitol-hill-violence
    Specifically Ted Cruz, Dan Crenshaw (R-TX), and Kayleigh McEnany
    I am writing to urge that Harvard examine any current or future associations with lawmakers and other people 
        who aided in this attempted overthrow of our democracy. As I have told you in past conversations, I do 
        believe that we need more politically conservative voices on campus. I still believe this. I am also a
        firm believer in academic freedom, and I will not compromise on that stance. However, we must have minimum 
        standards to which we hold those associated with Harvard. Those standards surely include supporting free 
        elections and not encouraging violence. If we do not insist that those at Harvard do not try to overturn 
        the free and fair votes of other citizens or that they would not encourage the violent overthrow of our 
        own government, then we have no standards at all.

Coalition for a Safer Web is suing Apple demanding it remove Telegram from appstore
    https://www.rt.com/usa/512822-telegram-lawsuit-apple-remove/
    “Telegram currently serves as the preferred neo-Nazi/white nationalist communications channel, fanning 
        anti-Semitic and anti-black incitement during the current wave of protests across America,” 
    “Apple has not taken any action against Telegram comparable to the action it has taken against Parler to 
        compel Telegram to improve its content moderation policies.”

NSA advises companies avoid third-party DNS
    https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/nsa-advises-companies-to-avoid-third-party-dns-resolvers/
    Recommendation to companies / gov't agencies
    - Force all traffic to use only company-designated DNS resolvers
    - Block known DNS-over-HTTPS providers at company firewall
    - Gov't agencies avoid third-party resolvers until unified gov't DoH service available
        Use EINSTEIN 3 (E3A) as authoritative for all federal agency local DNS
            intrusion detection, analysis of federal network traffic
            uses classified watch list
            run by CISA, the same org whose Chris Krebs was fired for failing to see election fraud
            and allowed SolarWinds, the biggest gov't cyberattack ever
    DNS resolver attacks
    - outside attacker can redirect almost any request - even to your internal sites
    - "official" DNS (eg: ICANN) can be compromised (commonly by governments)
        Either get at servers themselves, or using great firewall or simply by coercing ISPs
