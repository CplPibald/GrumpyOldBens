where it's not just the neighbors; soon your neighborhood will be talking about you too
where we continue to avoid the wrath of the IRS by being poor podcasters

Zuck licked the third rail again
    https://www.zerohedge.com/technology/instagram-offers-users-41-pronouns-woke-mob-complains-there-arent-enough
    on the heels of the instagram for children story
    Instagram added a dropdown "Add pronouns to your profile"
    Zerohedge let twitter write their article
        Lots of complaints about missing "it/its"
        "This should just be a box for us to type in. Having us pick from a predetermined list excludes people who use less common neopronouns,"
        "GODDAMNIT INSTAGRAM GIVE US AN “ANY PRONOUNS” FEATURE"
        "why does it not let me put your/mom? this is incredibly discriminatory."
    
Klim Ai-1 airbag won't inflate if you miss a payment
    https://www.vice.com/en/article/93yyyd/this-motorcycle-airbag-vest-will-stop-working-if-you-miss-a-payment
    MotoGP made motorcycle airbags compulsory in 2018
        must cover collarbone and shoulders. Full or central back protection is optional, but must be full spine
        tested for inflation time, accidental inflation, impeding control of the motorcycle
        MFRs self-certify
    "a whole new era of a platform where analog meets digital and results in a superior protection story."
    Vest is $400 with disabled airbag module
        Must then download an app to activate it
        Activation is either $400 more (for a total of $800)
            or subscription for $12/mo ($120/yr)
    "if someone pauses their subscription and forgets to restart it, they won't actually be able to get their In&box 
        into ride-ready status when they go to turn it on. If they then choose to ignore the indicators and ride with 
        the In&box inactive, that's on them and we can expect it not to inflate in the event of a crash."
    Motherboard points out it's just like car companies paywalling features with OTA updates
        except that safety features are regulated on cars

Inslee vetoes bill to ban all gas-cars by 2030
    https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/inslee-vetoes-2030-target-for-electric-cars-set-by-washington-legislature/
    Bill discussed on GOB 153
    Vetoed because the bill would not go into effect without further legislation:
        once 3/4 of the vehicles on the road are subject to "road usage charge", a new tax on vehicle miles driven
    “Setting and achieving a goal of 100 percent electric vehicles is too important to tie to the implementation of a 
        separate policy like a road usage charge,”

Amazon Sidewalk goes live on June 8
    https://www.cnet.com/home/smart-home/amazon-sidewalk-will-create-entire-smart-neighborhoods-faq-ble-900-mhz/
    https://www.inc.com/jason-aten/amazons-sidewalk-network-is-turned-on-by-default-heres-how-to-turn-it-off.html
    Mesh network of all Echo, Alexa, Ring, Tile (smartlock) devices using bluetooth LE and wifi 900MHz
    "You'll share that bandwidth with your neighbors, creating a sort of network of networks that any 
        Sidewalk-compatible device can take advantage of. Along with making sure things like outdoor smart lights 
        and smart garage door openers stay connected when your Wi-Fi can't quite reach them, that'll help things 
        like Tile trackers stay in touch if you drop your wallet while you're out on a walk, or if your dog hops the fence."
    "As a crowdsourced, community benefit, Amazon Sidewalk is only as powerful as the trust our customers place 
        in us to safeguard customer data,"
    Going to flood the 900MHz band (amateur UHF band)
        interferes with older remotes, garage door openers
    Opt out using Alexa app

Biden cybersecurity EO
    https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/12/executive-order-on-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity/
    Seems like a complete overhaul of federal gov't IT
    rewrite federal contracts with IT services / cloud providers to require sharing all data about breaches
        "information and communications technology service providers (ICT)"
        incl. data retention, data sharing provisions
    Moving agencies to Zero Trust Architecture
        "no implicit trust granted to assets or user accounts based solely on their physical or network location"
        all permissions are user-based - network boundaries are no longer part of security architecture
    "Adopt multi-factor authentication and encryption for data at rest and in transit"
    Guidelines for minimum testing standards of vendor code
    "initiate pilot programs to educate the public on the security capabilities of Internet-of-Things (IoT) 
        devices and software development practices, and shall consider ways to incentivize manufacturers and 
        developers to participate in these programs."
    Create standard federal guidance for how to respond to cyberattacks
    Create "Cyber Safety Review Board" (yay more bureaucracy!"
        under Homeland Security
        only directed goal is to figure out what the board will do - mission statement, composition, etc
