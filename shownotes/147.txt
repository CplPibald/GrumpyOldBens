Police Executive Research Forum high-priority needs for self-driving cars
    https://www.technocracy.news/self-driving-cars-will-stop-for-police-roll-windows-down-unlock-doors/
    "High-priority needs" for driverless cars:
        - vehicles need LE authorization to run in automated mode
            incl. full database info on car/owner
        - LE can communicate with vehicles in automated mode
            fine, if that communication is the same as blinking lights
        - vehicles as "evidence sources"
            even cars passing an accident scene
    license plate readers were just the beginning
    Safety?  Or money?
        How do you decide an autonomous vehicle is unsafe?
            who do you ticket?
        autonomous cars as surveillance system
        some cities get up to 80% of revenue from traffic tickets

    Waymo "police interaction protocol":
        Cars are designed to pull over automatically, unlock doors and roll down windows
        24hr LE hotline dedicated to allowing police/fire/firstresponders to talk to Waymo's call center
            to remotely control/shutdown the car
    Remote control could also help with theft - drive to police stn with thief locked inside
        or political dissident
        hackers?  "Terrorists"?
    "EDR" blackbox data recorder module for forensics
        Cars have had this, but the more data is in the computer, the more is logged
        Great for insurance co
        warrant?  Insurance ToS?
        2015 Mtn View incident, EDR showed that the operator "barely touched" the steering wheel for 37 mins prior to crash
            leading NHTSA to determine it was operator error (WAT?)
    Concl-1: If we can get to the utopia of everybody uses an AV, then we won't need cops
        Police need to be trustworthy
        People could never own cars again
        Cars work for police/insurance and not for "owner"
    Concl-2: if cars continue working for owner, then
        can't trust them to always be autonomous, because owner must be able to override
        police can't assume a car will behave (same as now)
        software must become open sourced
