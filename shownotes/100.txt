TIGTA investigating IRS CI division for illegal use of databases
    https://www.vice.com/en/article/qj479d/irs-investigation-location-data-no-warrant-venntel
    Treasury Inspector General for Tax administration
        founded in 1999 as independent oversight of IRS
    CI = Criminal investigation division of the IRS (the guys with the shotguns)
    CI admitted at a hearing in June that it had purchased location data from databroker named Venntel
        Venntel buys location data from games, weather, e-commerce, other apps.  Then sells to gov't clients
        CI tried to use phone location info to determine where people lived, to out tax dodgers
    Attempt failed, but Sens. Wyden and Warren asked TIGTA to investigate whether it was legal without warrant
        Carpenter v. United States (2018) SCOTUS ruled that warrant was needed to get cell location info
    IRS still has database, of course

    ``Boeing said it will make the mid-2021 move to “preserve liquidity” and “enhance efficiency and improve performance for the long-term,” ``
    HQ moved to Chicago in 2001
    framed as move away from unions
        Right-to-work laws prevent unions from compelling membership as a condition of employment

    and a move away from high taxes
        In 2004, Gov. Locke passed a "tax break" lowering B&O tax on aerospace
        worth $100M in 2018
        repealed in 2020 because EU was planning to impose retaliatory tariffs
        WA B&O tax (in lieu of corporate income tax) levied on gross receipts, rather than net
        Legislature tried to lower all mfr. tax to aerospace level to appease EU.  Inslee vetoed.
    Inslee called it "an insult", as if Boeing owes the state decades more of high taxes and cost of business
        but mere months ago, he was threatening to jack up taxes on them if they didn't commit to staying
        Inslee says Boeing wouldn't even take his calls

Mathematical Association of America: "Math is racist"
    https://www.rebelnews.com/math_is_racist
    follow up to story from GOB 85 about Brooklyn College professor
    Yet one more institution compromised by social justice
    https://www.mathvalues.org/masterblog/anti-science-policy-censure-of-discourse-on-race-and-racism
    Penned by the "Committee for Minority Participation in Mathematics"
    "Anti-science Policy and the Censure of Discourse on Race and Racism"
        most projection in a headline I've read all year
    Quotes
        "Thanks to science and mathematics, we understand now that masks, social distancing, frequent, rapid, mass testing,
            and contact tracing are all fundamental to keep our communities safer during the COVID-19 pandemic.
            Yet policies at the federal level have not consistently reflected these facts"
        "Critical race theory, referenced in recent Executive statements by the President of the United States, 
            is an established social science inquiry which is grounded in decades of scholarship."
        "Although mathematics, science, and higher education develop fact-based theories and practices, 
            they are also political because they exist within a highly politicized system."
        "As mathematicians, we notice patterns - this is something we are all trained to do. We bring these Executive 
            actions to our community’s attention for several reasons: we see the pattern of science being ignored 
            and the pattern of violence against our colleagues that give voice to race and racism."
        "It is time for all members of our profession to acknowledge that mathematics is created by humans 
            and therefore inherently carries human biases."  
        "The time is now to move mathematics and education forward in pursuit of justice."
