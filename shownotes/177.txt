    via SirVo

    Reddit won't allow links to videos; just links to comments
        enter video save scripts, bots
            eg: u/SaveVideo
    Bot operator received takedown letter (via their hosting company)
        Shut down 
        “The gods of reddit have reached out to us. They do not want us to continue this service any longer.”
    Lots of negative press pointed at reddit
        The next day, the bot was back up.
        Reddit contacted bot author and said it wasn't them
    Posted PDF takedown
        from "Reddit Safety" (wait, copyright, or safety?)
        The word "Reddit" is capitalized all through the document
    grammar errors
        "Redditsave.com acting as a browser and accessing our media database and illegally finding the source 
            of media files such as "v.redd.it & i.redd.it" links."
        "going against Reddit content policy."
        "You must "Take Down Redditsave.com and its services" within 3-4 days otherwise-
                We are going to file a lawsuit under trademark infringement US law U.S.C. § 1063 section. During the 
                pendency of the lawsuit, you (owner of Redditsave.com) are responsible for paying your
                Attorney’s monthly bills. As Redditsave.com misused the Media API and costs Bandwidth of
                Reddit servers, we need a "Compensation Penalty" of 1,000,000 or 1 Million American
                Dollars. If you failed to pay the compensation will face strict verdict from USA Jurist section."
            15 USC 1063: Opposition to [trademark] registration
                clarifies the issuance of trademarks in 1062, and provides a mechanism to oppose them before they're issued
        "Scrutinized by, Marcos Glenn- Reddit Safety Team head."

Muse adding CLA to Audacity
    https://hackaday.com/2021/07/13/muse-group-continues-tone-deaf-handling-of-audacity/
    via coldacid

    Muse is adding a Contributor License Agreement you must sign before contributing code
        which says you agree to your code being relicensed
    "It is not necessary for every single person who ever contributed to sign the CLA; only people who made a 
        non-trivial contribution that is still present in the current source code have to sign, as well as all new contributors."
    Q. How does the CLA benefit the community?
        A. The CLA enables us to release Audacity on platforms that we wouldn't otherwise be able to release on, 
            such as within Apple's App Store. It also enables us to change the project license in the future, 
            should the need arise. For example, we might decide to switch to a different open source license to 
            take advantage of a new technology that is incompatible with the current license, like when we switched 
            MuseScore's license from GPLv2 to GPLv3 to enable support for VST3. Alternatively, we might decide 
            to dual-license certain parts of the code under a permissive license in order to create an open standard 
            that is usable across all audio applications.

Tesla quotes $16k for a $700 fix - why we need right to repair
    https://www.thedrive.com/news/41493/teslas-16000-quote-for-a-700-fix-is-why-right-to-repair-matters
    Dude runs over road debris, damages a plastic coolant fitting on the side of the battery pack
        Tesla's ToS says the battery pack is not serviceable
        Tesla service center gave estimate of $16k to replace battery pack
            (comp insurance didn't cover road debris)
    Electrified Garage (NJ) shop were able to replace plastic fitting with an off-the-shelf brass one
        total cost = $700; mostly labor
    Tesla didn't offer to give used part back to him; balked when he asked for it (NJ legal requirement)
        They were going to "refurbish" the pack and sell it again
    The Drive couldn't ask for Tesla's side, since they have no PR dept
    Tesla ToS also says they'll ban your car from supercharging network if they detect any "unsupported repairs"
