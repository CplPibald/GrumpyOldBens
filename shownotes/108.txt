    WOTC blocked new drafts of all source material, effectively canceling last Dragonlance trilogy (because WOTC still owned IP)
        while dealing with a bunch of accusations of workplace sexism
    And were conducing a woke rewrite of all D&D source material
        https://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/diversity-and-dnd
        "Throughout the 50-year history of D&D, some of the peoples in the game—orcs and drow being two of the 
            prime examples—have been characterized as monstrous and evil, using descriptions that are painfully 
            reminiscent of how real-world ethnic groups have been and continue to be denigrated."
        "We are incorporating sensitivity readers into our creative process"
