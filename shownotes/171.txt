    asks consumers from 5-10pm
        set thermostats to 78F or higher if health permits
        Avoid using major appliances (cooking)
    do outside of hours:
        pre-cool home, use appliances, charge devices
        charge EVs
    Patty Monahan = commissioner on transportation at Cal Energy Commission
        "By incentivizing, primarily through rates, charging behaviors that capitalize on when renewable energy is being 
            generated—we basically have a win for the grid, and we have a win for the drivers in terms of reduced rates. 
            Rates are a climate strategy, and California plans on using rates to help drive the charging behaviors that 
            are going to help the state electrify transportation while cutting carbon from the grid and saving ratepayers and drivers money."

WHO demands women of child bearing age not drink alcohol
    https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2021/06/17/w-h-o-demands-women-of-child-bearing-age-not-drink-alcohol/
    https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/who-ban-women-childbearing-alcohol/
    https://junkee.com/who-global-action-alcohol-sexism/298815
    WHO draft of Global Alcohol Action Plan 2022-2030
        "Alcohol remains the only psychoactive and dependence-producing substance that exerts a significant impact on 
            global population health that is not controlled at the international level by legally binding regulatory instruments.”
    'Advocacy, awareness and commitment' section
        “prevention of drinking among pregnant women and women of childbearing age.”
            15-50 yrs, according to other WHO docs
    Top three google links are "fact check"
        Snopes was #2 link in DDG
        Snopes = "FALSE"  WHO isn't instituting or enforcing the ban (no, they're recommending it to gov'ts)
            (in Rainn Wilson's voice)
        #1 in DDG was NBCNews
            "The WHO alcohol-pregnancy warning for childbearing women overlooks men, as usual"
            "Men who drink can damage fetuses as well, but they aren’t mentioned by the World Health Organization. 
                The entire burden — and blame — of childbirth is still put on women."
