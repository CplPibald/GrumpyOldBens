Facebook censors people saying ANTIFA is setting fires
    https://www.9news.com/article/news/local/wildfire/antifa-facebook-wildfires-oregon/283-a4688f59-1692-43a4-894b-4c561d274052
    Sept. 12, Andy Stone, a policy communications manager at Facebook, announced on Twitter the social media giant is 
        "removing false claims the wildfires in Oregon were started by certain groups. This is based on confirmation 
        from law enforcement that these rumors are forcing local fire and police agencies to divert resources from 
        fighting the fires and protecting the public. This is consistent with our past efforts to remove content 
        that could lead to imminent harm given the possible risk to human life as the fires rage on."

    The governor's efforts "were undertaken with the good intention of addressing a public health emergency. 
        But even in an emergency, the authority of government is not unfettered. The Constitution cannot accept 
        the concept of a 'new normal' where the basic liberties of the people can be subordinated to open-ended 
        emergency mitigation measures."
    “well-intentioned effort to protect Pennsylvanians from the virus … good intentions toward a laudable end 
        are not alone enough to uphold governmental action against a constitutional challenge.”
    Restrictions in PA can't be enforced:
        size of indoor/outdoor gatherings 
        stay-at-home order
        closing all "non-life-sustaining" businesses
    Lawsuit didn't challenge mask mandate
    PA state health secretary Rachel Levine: "anything that limits our ability and the number of tools we have is a challenge to public health."
