Amazon publishes Brand Protection Report on fake vendors
    https://www.msn.com/en-in/money/technology/a/ar-BB1gzoqh
    Verification process
        one-on-one video calls, physical interactions
        claim to have banned over 6 million seller applications

Amazon data breach reveals fake review scam
    https://www.safetydetectives.com/blog/amazon-reviews-leak-report/
    SafetyDetectives uncovered an open Elasticsearch database (7Gb of data)
        Unknown who owns the database.  Server is in China
    Direct messages between Amazon vendors and customers willing to provide fake reviews in exchange for products
        Vendor sends reviewer a list of products they want a 5start review on
        People buy products and leave 5start review.  
            Then vendor gives refund through paypal (not Amazon, so review looks legit)
        "Here is the proces to get the sample: Every person can only get one sample
            Step 1. Provide your amazon profile link, just for a check
            Step 2. After checking we will give you the product URL to order it on Amazon
            Step 3. Provide your order ID and paypal account to us
            Step 4. We will refund you after review shared successfully.  No cover tax and shipping fee"
    Leaked DB contained vendor email addresses, whatsap/telegram numbers
        links to reviewer account profiles, fullname (on site), email, paypal accounts
    Vendors face FTC fines over $10M, having their products/accounts pulled from Amazon
    Sellers could face jail time if gov't decides to investigate

Amazon used seller data to boost sales - and senior leadership knew (Politico)
    https://www.politico.eu/article/amazon-seller-data-company-sales/
    Vendor Central program boosts sales, but Amazon controls price, placement, etc
    Amazon collects sales data for third-party sellers
        They have a policy that prohibits Amazon employees from using that data to boost sales of Amazon Basics
        Bezos called in front of Congressional antitrust hearing last July after WSJ reported they did exactly that
        "What I can tell you is, we have a policy against using seller-specific data to aid our private label business, 
            But I can’t guarantee you that that policy has never been violated.”
        supermarkets do this too
    EU Commission opened investigation in Nov 2020
    Politico interviewed Dutch seller Peter Sorber
        sold children's clothes on Amazon.  About 18mo in, revenue dropped from €10,000/wk to near zero 
        because they weren't in the search listings
        Sales rep moved on.  Nobody would answer calls at Amazon
        same story for others (Politico interviewed coffee seller in Germany)
            who lost business when Amazon starts selling direct
    Politico got access to an internal report
    "Spoofer Access" = tool Amazon uses to edit others' accounts as the seller
        Unsecured - anyone in the company could use, with almost no logs
        Last year, FBI discovered an employee used spoofer to "falsely and fraudulently issue $96,508.13 in refunds to himself and others."

        bribes, market manipulation, leaking algo data, shutting down competitors



Signal's honest facebook campaign
    https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/06/facebook-and-signal-are-fighting-over-an-ad-campaign.html
    https://signal.org/blog/the-instagram-ads-you-will-never-see/
    "You got this ad becaues you're a K-pop-loving chemical engineer. This ad used your location to see you're in Berlin.
        and you have a new baby and just moved. And you're really feeling those pregnancy exercises lately"
    "You got this ad becaues you're a GP with a Masters in art history. Also divorced. This ad used your location to see
        you're in London. Your online activity shows you've been getting into boxing, and you're probably getting there on
        your new motorcycle."
    Signal claims FB disabled their ad account before the campaign went live
    Facebook claims they forgot to click the "submit" button
        "This is a stunt by Signal, who never even tried to actually run these ads"
        "If Signal had tried to run the ads, a couple of them would have been rejected because our advertising policies 
            prohibit ads that assert that you have a specific medical condition or sexual orientation, as Signal should 
            know. But of course, running the ads was never their goal — it was about getting publicity."
        (aren't all ads about getting publicity?)
