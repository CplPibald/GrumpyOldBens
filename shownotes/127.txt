Twitter's hypocrisy intensifies around Uganda election

    https://humanevents.com/2021/01/12/twitter-responds-to-ugandas-social-media-shutdown-we-strongly-condemn-internet-shutdowns-amid-platform-wide-conservative-purge/
    https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/1/12/unprecedented-violence-as-uganda-gears-up-for-elections
    Background in Uganda:
        Ruling candidate President Yoweri Museveni vs opposition party Bobi Wine
            Museveni bidding for 6th term
            Wine was a popular singer/entertainer
        Wine was jailed while doing an interview
            “I have to end the interview because I can see soldiers beating my security guards"
        Riots ensued, over 50 people killed in clashes with police
        UN Sec-General Antonio Guterres called this "one of the bloodiest election campaigns in decades"
        aljazeera: "Ugandan polls are often marred by allegations of rigging. The country has never seen a peaceful 
            transfer of power since independence from Britain in 1962."
    1) Twitter bans pro-ruling-party accounts three days before Uganda election
    2) Museveni instructs all Ugandan ISPs to block Twitter
        also facebook, whatsapp, signal, and viber
        and over 100 VPNs
        gave reason of "the arrogance of American social media companies meddling in our election"
        “That social channel you are talking about, if it is going to operate in Uganda, it should be used 
            equitably by everybody who wants to use it. If you want to take sides against the [ruling party],
            then that group will not operate in Uganda.”
    3) Twitter's "Global Policy Team" posts
        "Ahead of the Ugandan election, we're hearing reports that Internet service providers are being ordered to block social media and messaging apps.
        "We strongly condemn internet shutdowns – they are hugely harmful, violate basic human rights and the principles of the #OpenInternet."
        "Access to information and freedom of expression, including the public conversation on Twitter, is never more 
            important than during democratic processes, particularly elections."
    All this less than a week after banning Trump and instituting their Nth conservative purge
Facebook bans: 
    Law Enforcement Today group
        https://reclaimthenet.org/facebook-bans-admins-of-law-enforcement-today/
        900k members.  Group disbanded, admins can't log in.
    Ron Paul
        https://fee.org/articles/facebook-suspends-ron-paul-following-column-criticizing-big-tech-censorship/
        because he criticized big tech censorship
        explanation "repeatedly going against our community standards"
Instagram censored image from notthebee.com
    https://notthebee.com/article/instagram-just-pulled-one-of-our-posts-for-violence-and-incitement--the-post-was-a-screen-shot-of-twitters-trending-topics
    for "violence and incitement"
    the image was a screenshot of Twitter's trending topics
    "the day after permanently banning Trump for "inciting violence," Twitter really did allow "Hang Mike Pence" to 
        trend. Multiple forms of that sentiment, actually."
    So basically Instagram accused Twitter of "violence and incitement"

    Company spokesman said "it was fielding calls from customers asking that the service not display the sites on the internet,
        and that they didn't want their children to be able to access them."
    “There are too many people that have called for us to do one [customer] at a time so we will be blocking 
        [Facebook and Twitter] and any other website that may also be censoring,”
    "Our company does not believe a website or social networking site has the authority to censor what you see 
        and post and hide information from you, stop you from seeing what your friends and family are posting. 
        This is why with the amount of concerns, we have made this decision to block these two websites from being accessed from our network."

    "They are already on everybody's block list because of the cross-platform harassment of @CreatrixTiara
        in the early days of Mastodon, but they also are into conspiracy theories which are low-key anti-Semitic. 
        Their podcast is also doing covid conspiracies."

    Two pieces of "proof":

        A thread on another instance 
            "noagenda dot social seems to be wall-to-wall antisemitic conspiracy theories"
            " I don't know about the show. Their Masto instance's public timeline is full of New World Order memes, 
                which is an anti-semitic conspiracy theory."
        someone explains NA show in the thread
            "I hope it's not presumptuous of me to warn you that that sounds like a potential radicalisation [sic]
                pathway into some extremely harmful politics."

Recall petition for Univ. of Michigan Regent Ron Weiser for not being fast enough with the groupthink
    https://www.change.org/p/university-of-michigan-regents-and-president-schlissel-recall-u-m-regent-ron-weiser-for-complicity-in-capitol-violence
    Weiser was asked on Jan 7 if Trump bears blame for violence.
        "I don't know. I didn't read any of that stuff, and I didn't watch television. I watched Michigan destroy 
        Minnesota in basketball, and that kind of contest is something that I strongly support."
    This makes him "complicit in Wednesdays historic and horrifying events"
    ``Initially, we and many others tried to give Weiser the benefit of the doubt with regards to his comments on
        Thursday. Surely, we thought, he did not condone the actions of a President which have led countless 
        members of Congress to call for the invocation of the 25th Amendment for his removal, and forced 
        Vice President Pence to move forward in certifying the election results in direct conflict with his President. ``
    ``After pressure to clarify his stance on Trump’s actions, Weiser did not relent. He released a statement 
        “strongly condemn[ing] those people who turned into a mob...after what was supposed to be a peaceful protest. 
        Those who broke the law should be held accountable.” ``

m5m accuses Louie Gohmert of "insurrection" after he quotes Pelosi on the house floor
    https://thefederalist.com/2021/01/13/media-are-accusing-a-republican-lawmaker-of-insurrection-for-quoting-nancy-pelosi/
    “Here’s a quote. ‘I just don’t even know why there aren’t more uprisings all over the country, and maybe there will be,’”
        Gohmert said on the House floor during the impeachment debate.
    Blake News from Politico quotes out of context
    Sarah Reese Johnes from Politicus:
        "Louie Gohmert calls for more violent uprisings claims Nancy Pelosi is destroying the American experiment 
        and quotes the History Channel in about two minutes."
    Asha Rangappa from CNN: 
        “Holy shit. Is Gohmer encouraging MORE “uprisings”??!? Did I hear that right??????????”
    Jason Applebaum from KTVU Fox:
        "Louie Gohmert literally asked for Trump supporters to commit violence on live TV prior to the insurrection. Why is he even there???"
    Ezra Levin, activist
        "Gohmert is the id of the GOP caucus. He just said on the House floor: "Here's a quote for ya, why aren't there more uprisings all over the country?"
