    from OMB director Russell Vought
    "All agencies are directed to begin to identify all contracts or other agency spending related to any training
        on 'critical race theory', 'white privilege', or any other training or propaganda effort that teaches or 
        suggests either (1) that the United States is an inherently racist or evil country, or (2) that any race
        or ethnicity is inherently racist or evil"
    "These types of "trainings" not only run counter to the fundamental beliefs for which our Nation has stood since 
        its inception, but they also engender division and resentment within the Federal workforce,"
