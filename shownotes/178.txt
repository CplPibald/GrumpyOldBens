where getting hacked by an Israeli spyware company is how you know you've made it

Apple removes Fakespot app on Amazon's say-so
    https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/07/16/apple-reportedly-removes-fakespot-from-app-store-at-amazons-request
    https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/16/22580611/fakespot-ios-app-apple-amazon-fake-reviews
    Fakespot detects and points out "false reviews and reviewers"
        on Amazon, TripAdvisor, Walmart, and Yelp
        call themselves a data analytics firm
    Launched in June 2021
        https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2021/06/03/2241643/0/en/Fakespot-Rolls-Out-the-Fakespot-Secure-Shopping-App-The-Best-Way-to-Shop-Amazon-on-Mobile-Devices.html
        Rates reviews and sellers
        "Highlights pros and cons about a product without having to read thousands of reviews"
        Have to create an account - to "maintain their analysis history across the desktop extension and mobile app"
            people don't even think twice about creating new accounts anymore
    Amazon went to Apple and claimed that Fakespot was "wrapping" their website
        and that it could be exploited to steal Amazon customer data (RB: more than Amazon is doing already?)
        "5.2.2 Third-Party Sites/Services: If your app uses, accesses, monetizes access to, or displays content from a 
            third-party service, ensure that you are specifically permitted to do so under the service’s terms of use. 
            Authorization must be provided upon request."
        “We regularly review products where Fakespot rated a product’s reviews as untrustworthy and their findings 
            were wrong more than 80% of the time. They simply do not have the information we have—such as reviewer, 
            seller and product history—to accurately determine the authenticity of a review.”

Pegasus data leak
    https://www.theguardian.com/news/2021/jul/18/huge-data-leak-shatters-lie-innocent-need-not-fear-surveillance
    Surveillance software written by NSO group from Israel
        NSO's official response: "We firmly deny the false allegations" "wrong assumptions" "uncorroborated theories"
    Leaked list of 50k phone numbers, along with date/time they were entered into a system (back to 2016)
        Shared only with "journalists" incl. Guardian - not public
            nonprofit org of media outlets called "Forbidden Stories"
        media outlets identified over 1000 people
            65 business executives
            18 members of arab royal families
            189 "journalists"
            600+ politicians - incl. heads of state and cabinet
            "in the coming days the Guardian will be revealing the identities of many innocent people who have been identified"
        Clusters in 10 countries - gov't clients of NSO
            Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Hungary, India, Kazakhstan, Mexico, Morocco, Rwanda, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.
    Forensic analysis of 67 phones from list showed "attempted and successful" intrusion
        23 had Pegasus installed
        14 showed signs of attempted penetration
        30 inconclusive (sometimes because the handset was replaced)
        iphones log everything - easy to tell
        Androids don't keep logs

dekuNukem Bob Cassette Rewinder
    https://github.com/dekuNukem/bob_cassette_rewinder
    Bob Dishwasher by Daan Tech
    Internet-connected dishwasher that fits on your countertop
        internal water tank - fill by hand; no plumbing
    "It arrived after a 2-months wait, and overall I'm very happy with it. It fits on my kitchen top, has 
        enough space for my dishes, uses a tiny amount of water, and overall works just fine. No problems."
    Bob Cassette = all-in-one detergent cartridge
        Lasts 30 washes
        Printer ink model = cheap product, outrageous cost on subscription
            same model as sodastream
        43 euro (about $60) for 90 washes (only from their website) after shipping and VAT - or 67c per wash
            internet is so it can order new cassettes when it runs low
        Also, what happens if company inevitably goes out of business?
    If cassette runs out, you can add your own, but Daan Tech advises against
    So dekuNukem hacked it.
        Cassette has an 24C02 EEPROM, which can hold 256 bytes of data
            Connected to a computer (alligator clips, hacky wires, etc) and dumped memory
            washed again, dumped memory
            only one byte had changed
        Modified and put back - it worked
    What to fill with?  Daan Tech doesn't say what
    Found right detergent and rinsing liquid using spec sheets.  Measured amounts, calculated concentrations
        6 eur for 5L of detergent
        6.29 eur for 5L of rinse aid
    Total cost = 1.1c per wash = 98% cost saving
        5L detergent = 3yrs of daily washes.  5L rinse = 12yrs
    Now DekuNukem sells the Bob Rewinder - a USBC-to-PCB connector, and open-source software to rewind cartridges
    Daan advertises "positive cycle" of green practices
        "fighting against single-use plastics"
        yet sends single-use cassettes that only last a fixed time and aren't reusable
            similar to sodastream CO2 canisters
            or juice packets, etc
