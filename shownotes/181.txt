where traffic laws are now optional
where humanity is an extremist hate group

Wrong-way driver on I-5
    https://komonews.com/news/local/state-patrol-says-troopers-were-unable-to-pursue-wrong-way-driver-because-of-new-law
    "vehicle driving erratically" refused to stop
    Turned around on ramp, traveling wrong way.  Head-on collision
    @wspd7pio: "Earlier today a Motors Trooper attempted to stop a vehicle south on I-5 in Everett for driving recklessly.
        The vehicle did not stop and continued to drive erratically. The trooper was unable to pursue the vehicle and
        the suspect continued driving recklessly."
    "Under HB 1054, law enforcementcannot pursue a vehicle unless there is probable cause that someone in the vehicle 
        is believed to have committed or is committing a violent or sex offense or if there is reasonable suspicion 
        that the person is driving under the influence, among other reasons"
WA HB 1054 - no pursuits - went into effect Sunday 25 July
    Many police depts changing policy to not respond to mental health calls unless someone is in danger
        because they interpret that they can't restrain people
        cannot pursue a suspect leaving scene of crime (probable cause)
    Allowed to defend self if suspect pulls a gun/knife/weapon, but "only as a last resort"
    "officers responding to domestic violence calls to tell everyone on the scene to stay put, because police are 
        investigating a crime. If a suspect then flees, the officers could arrest that person for obstruction"
        So we're not allowed to arrest people for DV anymore, but "obstruction"
            "obstruction" = a made-up crime
    Explanatory article defers a lot to "the lead drafters" of the law for clarification what should and shouldn't be okay

German Federal Court of Justice rules against facebook on censorship
    https://www.msn.com/en-ca/news/world/reuters/ar-AAMHFHc
    Ruled FB's ToS regarding deletion of posts and blocking accounts are "null and void"
        because FB doesn't inform user of takedown/block, they don't give a reason, and they don't offer an appeal
    Post in question:
        "Migrants can murder and rape here and nobody cares! It's about time the Office for the Protection of the Constitution sorted this out"
        FB calls this hate speech
        for that matter so does Reuters

Intel stops shipping Itanium
    https://honeypot.net/post/the-itanic-has-sunk/
    Invented in 1994; never took off in 32-bit world
        Intel wouldn't work on a Pentium-compatible 64bit processor because it would cannibalize Itanium
    AMD launched Opteron in 2003 using AMD64.  Eventually Intel started making amd64 CPUs
    HP discontinued Itanium mainfraims in 2015
    Intel was contractually obligated to continue a few more years
        Last itaniums were 32nm when all other processors are now 10, 7, or 5nm
