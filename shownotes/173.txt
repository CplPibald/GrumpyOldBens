RANT: people hate ranked choice voting because it helped a communist
    now Adam is on board

made a point about gatekeeping using JCD's IPA example...
    "I don't care if a Hazy IPA is technically an IPA by some arbitrary definition. I only care whether it is good to drink."

Porsche won't sell manual transmision in 911 GT3 in California

    502hp
    auto "PDK gearbox" passes the noise test.  Six-speed manual does not.
        Society of Audio Engineers specifies test (SAE J1470)
        vehicle accelerates past a microphone from 50km/h (31mph) until engine reaches peak rpm
    "the throttle shall, as rapidly as possible, be opened as fully as will ensure maximum acceleration without operating kickdown"
        which is a forced downshift into first
        The porsche can do 50mph in first gear...  So they can't put the pedal down without a downshift in an auto
    There's a newer testing guideline, but CA uses the one made in 1984

Microsoft signs malware driver
    https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/microsoft-admits-to-signing-rootkit-malware-in-supply-chain-fiasco/
    All kernel code since Vista must be signed
        by default must be a MSFT cert
    Netfilter driver = rootkit
        found by analyst Karsten Hahn from G Data
        communicates with chinese c2 (command+control) IPs
            IP belongs to Ningbo Zhuo Zhi Innovation Network Technology Co., Ltd
                which USDoD has identified as a front for CCP military
        self-updates (once in kernel mode, it can do anything)
    MSFT approved the netfilter vendor and signed the driver
    OPINION: Auto updates are supply chain vector
