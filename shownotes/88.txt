    says US fumbled coronavirus response because "We believe in freedom, individual freedom. We optimize for individual rights,"
    China "in their typical fairly authoritarian way, they did a very good job at suppressing the virus. There may

    "Oculus said that when a user logs in using a Facebook account, Facebook will use information related to 
        the use of VR and other Facebook products to "provide and improve your experience". It will also be used 
        to show the user personalised content, including ads."

    Palmer Luckey in 2014:
        "I guarantee that you won't need to log into your facebook account every tmie you wanna use the Oculus Rift"
        "You will not need a facebook account to use or develop for the rift.  That would be lame. I promise."
    Palmer Luckey in 2020:
        “In hindsight, the downvotes from people with more real-world experience than me were definitely justified,”
    Luckey "got fired" from fecesbook in 2016 for reasons not given.
        "I gave $10,000 to a pro-Trump group, and I think that's something to do with it"
    Facebook already had all your data from the oculus, even without account
    Features that need FB account:
        Chats, join friends (outside games) / parties, user-created events, share photo/video/stream to FB, messenger integration
