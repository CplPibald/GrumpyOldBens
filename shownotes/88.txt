    says US fumbled coronavirus response because "We believe in freedom, individual freedom. We optimize for individual rights,"
    China "in their typical fairly authoritarian way, they did a very good job at suppressing the virus. There may

    "Oculus said that when a user logs in using a Facebook account, Facebook will use information related to

    Palmer Luckey in 2014:
        "I guarantee that you won't need to log into your facebook account every tmie you wanna use the Oculus Rift"
        "You will not need a facebook account to use or develop for the rift.  That would be lame. I promise."
    Palmer Luckey in 2020:
        “In hindsight, the downvotes from people with more real-world experience than me were definitely justified,”
    Luckey "got fired" from fecesbook in 2016 for reasons not given.
        "I gave $10,000 to a pro-Trump group, and I think that's something to do with it"
    Facebook already had all your data from the oculus, even without account
    Features that need FB account:
        Chats, join friends (outside games) / parties, user-created events, share photo/video/stream to FB, messenger integration
