Youtube-DL source taken down from github by RIAA DMCA notice
    https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl
    https://soylentnews.org/article.pl?sid=20/10/24/0058203
    Youtube uses a cypher to trivially encode its video source (then sends JS to decode the cypher)
        Youtube-DL copies the JS algorithm and runs it in python
        which invokes anti-circumvention of DMCA
    Notice was given to Github (MSFT), who shut down github repo
        youtube-dl site still works, still has code
    Source code contained test cases and readme that download copyrighted music
    Lots of source mirrors available
        but the next YT change breaks all of them.  Needs more devs

    "I see a consensus here that there is no value in having a list that combines the qualities of a) being a scientist,
        in the general sense of that word, and b) disagreeing with the scientific consensus on global warming."

    Every online hivemind eventually moves left, because there are more unemployed leftists online
        and because they're willing to shout down dissenters
