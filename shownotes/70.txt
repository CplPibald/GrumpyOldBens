AMP is destroying the web
    Google hosts your page, with stripped down CSS on their own CDN
        Google's own standard, outside W3C.
        CSS limited in size, only inline.  No custom JS.  All images lazy loaded
        "giving up sovereignty"
            have to submit changes.  Less control.  And they change elements for "speed"
            all pages look the same
        Can't track with any analytics except Google's own tools
        Makes domain/IP filtering nearly impossible
    Changes internet from distributed peer-to-peer model to an everybody-to-google model

    AMP exists because sites are slow to load, especially on mobile
        75% because of 3rd-party requests, 25% because of javascript
        Google provides guides to speed up 3rd party requests
        but most of those requests are analytics, ads, social media widgets, trackers, and crap.
    Don't use Google search.  Qwant and DDG don't rank AMP sites.  Bing makes you jump through hoops
    Don't use Chrome browser.  Firefox defaults to blocking trackers
    As a user, filter out useless elements
        ad blocker, umatrix/noscript, pihole
    As a site owner, don't use AMP
