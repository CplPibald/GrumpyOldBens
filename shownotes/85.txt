        "In the last week, we’ve seen a trend in emergency if you like of groups of people, small groups, 
            but nonetheless concerning groups who classify themselves as sovereign citizens, whatever that might mean. 
            People who don’t think the law applies to them. We’ve seen them at checkpoints baiting police, not 
            providing their name and address. On at least three or four occasions in the past week, we’ve had to

            they weren’t telling us where they were going. They weren’t adhering to the chief health officer guidelines.

            is ... can speak to it, but maybe there needs to be stronger legislation to say that if you do not wear 
            a mask and you subject exposure of this virus to someone else then there will be some stronger penalty 
            as it is in other viruses that are exposed,”
        Mayor Jameson quickly pointed out that city council can't charge people or create criminal legislation
