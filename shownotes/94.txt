Google: "Hey, look at our virtue!", or "decarbonizing our energy"
    https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-54141899
    'Google says it has wiped out its entire carbon footprint by investing in "high-quality carbon offsets".'
    'It became carbon-neutral in 2007 and says it has now compensated for all of the carbon it has ever created.'
    https://sustainability.google/commitments/
    "We’re proud that we were the first major company to reach carbon neutrality and have become the world’s 
        largest corporate buyer of renewable energy.  But we know we must push further to confront the magnitude 
        of today’s climate challenge. Now, we aim to be the first major company to achieve 24/7 carbon-free energy by 2030."

        so really they're just choosing which power markets, which are a big bureaucracy to track power prices
        estimates seem to assume the "90% clean grid" which is 10% natural gas
    "carbon-intelligent computing platform"
        https://blog.google/inside-google/infrastructure/data-centers-work-harder-sun-shines-wind-blows/
        rearranging time of day of datacenter usage to correspond to peak wind and solar times
    commits to "achieve 24/7 carbon-free energy in our operations by 2030"
        Which means still not there
    "carbon-free energy" and "clean power" seems to be wind, solar, and hydro
        with lots of battery technology mixed in to compensate for variability in generation
        nuclear is "carbon-free" but not "renewable"
        biomass is "carbon-neutral" but not "carbon-free"
    https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/www.google.com/en//green/pdfs/renewable-energy.pdf
    Googleplex in Mtn View has "1.6 MW of solar panels (now grown to 1.9 MW), operate 400 kW of 
        fuel cells and have a 970 kW generator adjacent to our campus that burns landfill gas that would 
        otherwise have been vented to the atmosphere"
    And of course lobbying to push this as gov't policy

Renewable Energy Credits
    https://www.energysage.com/other-clean-options/renewable-energy-credits-recs/
    wind, solar, hydropower, biomass, geothermal
    "Buying RECs is not equivalent to buying electricity. Instead, RECs represent the clean energy attributes of renewable electricity."
    "there is no way to know exactly what energy source your electricity comes from. To solve this problem, 
        you can purchase RECs along with your electricity"
    Not transferable, so two companies can't take credit for the green energy, even if the power is re-sold
Home fuel cell generation
    https://www.alternativeenergyhq.com/home-fuel-cells-for-power-generation.php
    "The ClearEdge5 is a compact system which efficiently converts natural gas or propane into both electricity and heat."
    So it's gas power...  How is this green compared to a natural gas plant?
    "The Fuel Processor converts natural gas into ultra-clean hydrogen through a catalytic process, as opposed 
        to burning the natural gas, which dramatically reduces pollutants."
    Hydrogen fuel cells don't emit carbon
        but take energy input to make hydrogen.  So they're a battery.

Green energy (from 80.txt)
    Solar = max theoretical about 1GW/km2 at noon in summer; modern panels are about 15% efficient, land use about 30%, 
        so call it 10-20km2 of land.
        https://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2019/07/carbonfree_power_solar_versus_nuclear.html
    Wind = about 2MW/turbine, a 1Gw plant would spread over 100mi2
        can also use for crops/animals, but noise and vibrations keep people out
    nuclear = each plant produces about 1GW
    hydro = Bonneville Dam about 1.2 GW
    gas = about 560Mw/plant
Windmills
    - kill about 50k birds per year, compared to 8 million from glass panes, and 4 million from cats
    - can't recycle fiberglass resin blades, but super hard to cut up
    Betz's law
LFTR = molten salt reactor
    liquid fluoride thorium reactor
    can't have a nuclear meltdown.  Controls keep it hot; If all control systems break, it just cools down.
        if it fully cools, you write off the reactor
    Problems:
        - LF is extremely corrosive.  Design flaw could lead to water pooling under reactor.  Casing cracks, and dumps
        molten salt on it, flash boils water, and throws radioactive fluorine salts all over
        - Boron gas leak
        - waste = political problem, not engineering.  There's not actually that much, and we know how to store it.
            even then, after 100 years with unlimited energy, I bet we could find something better to do with it
