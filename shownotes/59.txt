Fun fact: Medicare and insurance payments are higher if the patient is diagnosed with COVID. 
  Therefore, hospitals have a financial incentive to diagnose as many cases as possible.
  State governors also have an incentive.  If they overreacted for no good reason, they might not get re-elected.

If your software doesn't have an offline mode that can be used without dialling the mothership, you don't own it.
  Servers could go down.  Company could go out of business.  Could get banned (even by accident)
  The only function steam client does is update

"right" to safety
  NJ Gov Phil Murphy on Tucker says he is suspending the Bill of Rights
     why are we not rioting in the streets over this?

  Public have elevated "safety" above all other ideals, including liberty.
  freedoms of religion, speech, and to peacably assemble ARE explicitly enumerated in the Constitution
    "public safety", not listed in the Constitution, not considered by that document to be as important (Public defense is mentioned)
    If you aren't willing to follow the Constitution, let's change it.  Or throw the whole thing out and have revolution
  Modern concept of safety is a positive right.
    negative = no one should harm you
    positive = protection from things we can't control
  Safety is impossible to achieve
    cops response time
    police/politicians/bureaucrats are not held liable when they don't protect us
    and yet they keep removing our ability to do it ourselves
  Safety as an ideal is incompatible with a free society.
    Asimov three laws
        A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.
        A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.
        A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Laws.
  I would rather be free than safe
    Obviously both would be better
    but with freedom I can take responsibility for my own safety.  
    Without freedom, I am entirely dependent on others who have no incentive to protect me.
