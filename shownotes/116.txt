Bruce Schneier swerves outside his lane and into politics - goes full TDS
    https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2020/11/undermining-democracy.html
        Previously appeared in the New York Times
        Tags: disinformation
        comments are clearly censored
    Rehashes "russian disinformation campaign of 2016"
    "When people's faith in the democratic system is undermined, democracy stops working"
        but he seems to think it was Trump's lawsuits that are undermining confidence, and not the fraud that predicated them
    Calls it "an insider attack"
        "In democracy, the insiders aren’t just the officials who manage voting but also the politicians who shape what people believe about politics.
        "For four years, Donald Trump has been trying to dismantle our shared beliefs about democracy. And now, his fellow Republicans are helping him"
    "Democracy works when we all expect that votes will be fairly counted, and defeated candidates leave office."
    "The fundamental problem, is Republican insiders who have convinced themselves that to keep and hold 
        power, they need to trash the shared beliefs that hold American democracy together."
    "We know how to make voting itself more open and more secure. The more difficult problem is this. How do you 
        shift the collective belief among Republicans that elections are rigged?"
        Oh, I dunno, MAYBE DON'T RIG ELECTIONS
Schneier signs on as an "expert" saying there's no evidence of fraud

    One-page letter amounting to a massive appeal to authority
        signed by 59 people with mostly university credentials
    The entire substance of the letter
        "We are aware of alarming assertions being made that the 2020 election was “rigged” by
        exploiting technical vulnerabilities. However, in every case of which we are aware, these claims
        either have been unsubstantiated or are technically incoherent. **To our collective knowledge**, no
        credible evidence has been put forth that supports a conclusion that the 2020 election outcome
        in any state has been altered through technical compromise."

Judicial Watch sues Colorado to clean up voter rolls
    https://www.judicialwatch.org/press-releases/co-voter-rolls/
    National Voter Registration Act of 1993
    In 2019, 40 out of 64 Colorado counties had registrations exceeding 100% of voting-age population
        8 counties had over 17% of registered voters inactive
    Also sued PA and NC for same thing earlier this year
    Sued IL in Sept for refusing to disclose voter roll data (in violation of federal law)
    2019 study found 378 counties nationwide had more registered voters than voting-age population
        Accounting for 2.5 million registrations over 100%
    These inaccurate voter rolls are what was used to send out absentee ballots

Facebook WoW project teaches algo to go easier on hate against whites
    https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/12/03/facebook-hate-speech/
    "According to the new proposals, it is not as wrong to spew “hatred” directed towards men, whites, Americans, 
        and Christians than it is to do the same against US-minority groups."
    numerical scores weighted based on their perceived harm
    engineers said they had changed the company’s systems to deprioritize policing contemptuous comments about “Whites,” “men” and “Americans.”
        categorized as "low-sensitivity", so not automatically deleted
    "Because describing experiences of discrimination can involve critiquing White people, Facebook’s algorithms 
        often automatically removed that content, demonstrating the ways in which even advanced artificial 
        intelligence can be overzealous in tackling nuanced topics."
    “We can’t combat systemic racism if we can’t talk about it, and challenging white supremacy and White men is an
        important part of having dialogue about racism,” said Danielle Citron, a law professor specializing in free
        speech at Boston University Law School, who also reviewed the documents. “But you can’t have the conversation 
        if it is being filtered out, bizarrely, by overly blunt hate speech algorithms.”

        kinda looks like "gif", but if you click it, it runs using ShellExecute()
