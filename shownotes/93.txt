Happy Terrorism Day
    U. Alaska Fairbanks study on WTC7 
    http://ine.uaf.edu/projects/wtc7/
    "The principal conclusion of our study is that the fire did not cause the collapse of WTC7 on 9/11, contrary
        to the conclusions of NIST and private engineering firms that studied the collapse.  The secondary conclusion
        of our study is that the collapse of WTC7 was a global failure involving the near-simultaneous failure of
        every column in the building."

Portland ban on facial recognition
    https://www.cnet.com/news/portland-passes-the-toughest-ban-on-facial-recognition-in-the-us/ 
    https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5967c18bff7c50a0244ff42c/t/5f3ad787ba3fd27776e444af/1597691785249/Ordinance+to+ban+use+of+FRT+in+Places+of+Public+Accommodation+plus+code+amendment+-Final.pdf
    Bans all gov't and private business use
        Exception for individual use like unlocking phone or insta filters

    SF, Boston, Oakland have already banned

    Portland bans all businesses too
        incl. at airports, where some airlines (Delta) use face recognition for boarding
        convenience stores identify shoplifters
    SF police were using business district cameras to monitor rioters

    Ordinance reads like a SJW manifesto
        1. Portland residents and visitors should enjoy access to public spaces with a
            reasonable assumption of anonymity and personal privacy. This is true for
            particularly those who have been historically over surveilled and experience
            surveillance technologies differently. 
        2. The City of Portland must be a welcoming city, a sanctuary city, and an inclusive
            city for all, including residents and visitors,
        3. City Code Chapter 23.01 on Civil Rights decrees the elimination of
            discrimination, that every individual shall have an equal opportunity to participate
            fully in the life of the City and that discriminatory barriers to equal participation be
            removed.
        8. Black, Indigenous and People of Color communities have been subject to over surveillance and disparate 
            and detrimental impact of the misuse of surveillance
        9. Face Recognition Technologies have been documented to have an unacceptable
            gender and racial bias. The City needs to take precautionary actions until these
            technologies are certified and safe to use and civil liberties issues are resolved.
        10. ***At the moment, the City does not have the infrastructure to evaluate Face
            Recognition Technologies***. Indiscriminate use of these technologies will degrade
            civil liberties and enable spaces or services that may be unfair to Black,
            Indigenous and People of Color. 
        12. ... particularly information from children and vulnerable and marginalized groups.
        15. ... keeping processes open, inclusive, and engaging
    Acknowledge they don't have the infrastructure to monitor every use of technology, but city council believes they
        should regulate it, and the city council should do it
        14.While uses of Face Recognition Technologies may have benefits, the risk for
            misidentification and misuse is always present. Safe use of these technologies
            requires adequate due process, transparency, and oversight measures to be
            trusted.
    Effective 1 Jan 2021 
        New policies to be fleshed out by Office of Equity and Human Rights along with City Attorney
            and Bureau of Planning and Sustainability
            - "develop a plan for creating public awareness on impacts and uses of Face
                Recognition Technologies particularly around children, Black, Indigenous and
                People of Color, people with disabilities, immigrants and refugees, and other
                marginalized communities and local businesses."
            - coordinate effective and meaningful public participation after the code
                provisions are approved. This effort should represent a diverse set of voices,
                expertise, and life experiences on issues around Face Recognition and other
                surveillance technologies
