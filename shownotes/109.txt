    450k ballots separated from envelope
    exclusion of observers
    More than 60-70 witnesses kept out of rooms during suspicious counts
Statistical explanation (stolen from @DrChris@nas)
    "Mail-in ballots arrive randomly, like a shuffled deck of cards, so when they are counted, the ratio of D to R 
        ballots is consistent, with maybe a slight shift toward R over time, as rural ballots take longer to arrive.  
        This trend held in 45 states.
    "In 5  States,  reporting on mail-in ballots was also consistent, until 2-4am, when the ratio shifted markedly 
        toward D - it would be like shuffling a deck and all the Spades fall to the bottom.  Impossible."
Hammer/Scorecard
    Plausibility?
    IF it exists, Biden camp would have access.  (Obama is in Biden camp, as is much of deep state)
    evidence: they're censoring it.
