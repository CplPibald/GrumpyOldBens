42-holiday

left coast where we don't have the budget to pre-produce a crappy holiday retrospective, so we're just have to do one live
left coast where full disclosure I don't even own a microwave oven

it's trash day...  why recycling still isn't economically feasible


Licensing
  drivers, hunting, etc. on the consumer side.
  But also trade licensing - plumbers, electricians, and (at least in my state), hair stylists

Certificate of Need laws
  "CON programs aim to control health care costs by restricting duplicative services 
  and determining whether new capital expenditures meet a community need."
  "The basic assumption underlying CON regulation is that excess health care facility 
  capacity results in health care price inflation."

"""
I block all ads, on all websites, without exceptions. Here is my feedback:

    All ads are spammy.
    All advertising networks are bad.
    All ads are low-quality.
    I don't care how carefully you vet them.
    Ads are not good content.
    If you have to sell ads to remain in business, your business model is, in the long-term, unsustainable, and you should be focusing your efforts on transitioning to a sustainable business model.
