where we don't eat off our keyboards
where becoming an expert is worth at least 100 points of identification

 first time I read a dvorak article he was crapping all over Windows Vista

        "to help victims of domestic violence"
    report from Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs
        "In order to open or maintain an existing social media account, customers should be required by law to identify 
            themselves to a platform using 100 points of identification, in the same way as a person must provide 
            identification for a mobile phone account, or to buy a mobile SIM card."
        "Social media platforms must provide those identifying details when requested by the eSafety Commissioner, law 
            enforcement or as directed by a court."
        "The Government should consider regulating to enable law enforcement agencies to access a platform’s end-to-end 
            encrypted data, by warrant, in matters involving a threat to the physical or mental wellbeing of an 
            individual or in cases of national security."

            “It’s a long bow to draw that if we give our passport to Facebook then suddenly people will not be abusive. 
                There’s no research to support that assumption.
            “We’d be giving over these identity documents to proprietary platforms that do not have our best interests at heart.”

Terramaster NAS exposing itself with UPNP
    https://kn100.me/terramaster-nas-exposing-itself-over-upnp/
    Terramaster F2-210
    noticed web interface was visible from outside the firewall
        ports 8181 (web interface), 5443 for SSL, 9091 (Portainer - container manager for Docker), and 8800
    NAS offers no way to disable upnp behavior
        changing ports poked new firewall holes using upnp, but didn't clear old ones
    Possible to SSH into the NAS and change config scripts, but who does that?
