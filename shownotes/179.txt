    Expansion to "About this result" box

    "Why was this result listed" is huge for SEO

EIP 1559 Ethereum fork

    Ethereum Improvement Proposal
    Current fee mechanism involves an "auction" to get transactions into the block
        base fee would replace this auction
        similar to BTC's dynamic PoW difficulty
    Changes gas fee mechanism by introducing a dynamically adjusted base fee
        which would be burned instead of given to miners
            counter to inflation from mining - eth is not capped like BTC
        Intent is to reduce volatility in gas fees
            base fee changes if blocks fill up beyond "gas target" when blocks are over/under 50% full
                which is always with current congestion...  so fees won't go down short-term
        Includes option to "tip the miners" 
            'to incentivize getting the block out faster' ???
        "Removes fee manipulation vectors - eg. ones where malicious miners fill up blocks with empty 
            transactions to inflate market prices"
    Also introduces variable block size from fixed 12.5M to floating
    Fees won't go down short-term, but fee prediction will be easier; and fewer/more predictable delays

93% of paint splatters are valid Perl
    https://www.mcmillen.dev/sigbovik/
    Started with a tweet
        @__apf__ "I don't want to teach my kid to code. I want him to splash in muddy puddles and smear point on the walls and read novels under the covers
            way too late at night. I grew up too soon and wish I'd had more time to be a kid. Why do schools teach vocational skills so young these days?"
        @jaffathecake "but is it possible to smear paint on the wall without creating valid Perl?"
    Colin McMillen and Tim Toady investigated exactly that
        Given an input image, use Tesseract OCR library (4.0.0-beta1) to extract candidate text
        Then feed that text into Perl 5.26.1
    "We are not aware of the existence of any standard paint-splatter datasets in the object recognition or OCR communities.
        Also, ImageNet’s website was down on the day that we decided to perform this research. We therefore paid an 
        unemployed person* to download 100 examples of paint-splatter artwork by searching Pinterest using the query
        “paint splatter wallpaper”."
        manually filtered images with text overlay
    Result was 100 splatter images.  93 of them were valid code
        https://www.mcmillen.dev/sigbovik/splatters.html
        20 can be parsed as numeric literals
        three can be parsed but result in errors (incl. division by zero)
        Most of the rest are parsed as unquoted strings
            (have to run perl without -w warning flag)
            ```Unquoted string "gggijgziifiiffif" may clash with future reserved word at - line 1.)```
    Scanned the icon from Nintendo's "Splatoon" image and concluded the result was NSFW
        footnote points out that it's perl that's not safe for work. The splat is fine.

Freenode exodus
    https://www.theregister.com/2021/05/19/freenode_staff_resigns/
    Andrew Lee, founder of Private Internet Access VPN
        acquired controlling interest in "Freenode Limited" in 2017
            Established to handle Freenode Live finances. Gained control over domain names too
        "promises were made that Lee would not have operational control over the IRC network"
        In May, all of the volunteer admins/devs/etc resigned
        Deopped many channel owners
    https://gist.github.com/joepie91/df80d8d36cd9d1bde46ba018af497409
        Accused of abuse of power over a competing botchannel ##hntop vs ##hnnew
            because ##hntop was moving to liberachat
        Retroactively changed freenode policies
        people complained.  Some lawyered.
    Projects that have moved:
        Ubuntu, gentoo, centos, wikimedia moved to LiberaChat
        #icechat channel moved to Quakenet
        adafruit, alpine linux, anarcat, sourcehut, dokuwiki
    Alternate perspective, calls it cancel culture
        http://techrights.org/2021/05/19/freenode-and-cancel-culture/
        aside: this author really hates that stuff is posted at github
        says freenode "owner" wanted to give visibility to his brother's business Shells,
            "which basically helps raise awareness of GNU/Linux"
            Promoted logo (where?  MOTD?)
        turned into cancel culture shitstorm
            “Trumpian wannabe korean royalty bitcoins millionaire.”
