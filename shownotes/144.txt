        yeah, and Tusky is now free to use an app store that aligns with its values
    June 2019 Tusky created a blacklist of mastodon instances that the app would refuse to log into

Mozilla rewriting the web with "b!tch-to-boss" extension
    https://blog.mozilla.org/firefox/firefox-b-tch-to-boss-extension/
    written by Mozilla, and highlighted on their official blog 
        and in Firefox pop-ups as a "recommended" extension
        which shows you what Mozilla "recommendations" are worth
    "About this extension"
        A person’s gender, age, race, or sexual orientation shouldn’t determine their access, opportunities, or 
            quality of experience online. And yet . . . here we are. B!tch to Boss finds and replaces all instances 
            of derogatory words like “bitch,” “slut,” and “nasty woman” to simply read “boss” across the web. 
            Will this solve harassment online? No. Will it make comments sections, unsolicited DMs, and angry 
            replies just a little bit funnier? Hopefully.
    changes multiple languages
        with a host of unicode and cultural issues
             e.g. the «conne» in «déconne» is replaced.

    comments:
        A lot of extensions and applications made by Mozilla are pretty useful. This one is not of them however.
        This addon could be excellent if it could replace or delete all swear words to protect my children for 
            example. But no it changes this one word and that is that no options, no customizations no effort at 
            all to do something useful or to make internet a better cleaner place.
        Nice idea, but maybe a whitelist for websites about dogs would be good
        made an account just to shit on this fucking addon.
        If you need to change a word to make yourself feel "strong and independent"... you are neither.
