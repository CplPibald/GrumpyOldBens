bright and sunny left coast where nice weather makes me grumpy
where I deftly avoided getting fleeced by a remote code exploit in my slime simulator

Apple fleeceware crisis
    https://www.forbes.com/sites/gordonkelly/2021/04/10/apple-iphone-app-store-fleeceware-scam-iphone-12-pro-max/
    apps designed to trick money out of users
        designed to prevent you from noticing large hidden charges
            the charge comes from Apple
            usually recurring (eg: weekly)
        Not picked up by malware review, because no virus code
        App does what it should.  But sends out bogus charges.
        pay for 5star reviews, which drown out bad reviews
    types:
        musical instrument, palm readers, image editors, camera filters, fortune tellers, PDF/QR readers, slime simulators
    ex: vpn app whose website is blank, making #32 in the app store utilities category
        making over $1M/mo  (with Apple taking 30% of course)
        dead phone numbers, nonexistent company addresses, blank webpages, etc
    https://techstory.in/how-to-see-whether-you-are-being-cheated-by-fleeceware-applications/
    Avast study found 204 fleeceware apps in app store; over 100 in one recommended list or another
            for an estimate $365M in revenue.  30% of that is $109M
        Same study found only 70 fleeceware apps on Google play
            for only $38M
    CHECK your purchase history!  Especially "subscriptions"
    Epic is using this in their lawsuit to stop the 30% tax-
        Cited "senior Apple engineer" in 'internal Apple documents'
            "Apple security is like 'bringing a plastic knife to a gunfight'"
            Security is "more like the pretty lady who greets you at the Hawaiian airport than the drug-sniffing dog"

Discord blocks all NSFW servers from iOS users

Discord changing policy to admin-mark servers as NSFW 
    https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500005389362-NSFW-Server-Designation
    if they are "organized around NSFW themes or if the majority of content is 18+"
    Server owners have always been able to mark specific channels or whole servers as NSFW
        Age 17 and younger not allowed to see
        Adults are given an annoy dialog
        now discord admins are marking NSFW for you automaticallybased on their criteria
        Appeals process outlined
            *Owner* must fill out web form with server ID, explanation.  It goes into a queue.
    "Additionally, all users on the iOS platform (including those aged 18+) will be blocked from joining and accessing 
        NSFW servers. iOS users aged 18+ will still be able to join and access NSFW communities on the desktop and web versions of Discord."
    Discord doesn't mention why, but this is in Apple ToS
        "Apps with user-generated content or services that end up being used primarily for pornographic content,
            Chatroulette-style experiences, objectification of real people (e.g. “hot-or-not” voting), making physical 
            threats, or bullying do not belong on the App Store and may be removed without notice."
