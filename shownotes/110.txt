    Spoilation of evidence

        Alito ordered PA to separate on-time from timely ballots
            if this didn't happen, it is spoilation of evidence
                specifically, discarding envelope with signature and date and corresponding ballot inside
            and case law says that it must be interpreted in the worst way posible against the spoiler
                meaning possibly ALL mail-in ballots in particular precincts being discarded
        SCOTUS probably won't rule a winner,
            but they could declare no electors allowed from that state
        Keeping only (R) observers away is prima facie evidence of criminal intent by (D) - aka obstruction of justice
        Supreme Court ruled in Bush v. Gore (2000) that election rules must be objectively followed - not subjectively applied
        Article II, sec. 1 of Constitution: "Each state shall appoint, in such manner as the legislature thereof may direct, a number of Electors..."
            Gov, Secstate, and state SC have no say.
            So state legislature of PA, GA, NC, WI, and AZ (all (R) legislatures) could convene and declare a winner

        Plot ratio between candidates over time.  Mail-in is constant with slight drift toward R (rural)
            45 states hold this pattern
        Actual graphs note jumps (balot dumps?) in ratio for WI, GA, MI, VA.  PA graph shows steady upward trend

            or lost votes, where the number just went down for no reason
