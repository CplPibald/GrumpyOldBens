where you can watch the Olympics like it's 1996 again
where you park your carbomb in the garage at your own risk

NBC doesn't want people watching the Olympics
    https://mleverything.substack.com/p/why-does-nbc-make-it-so-difficult
    Events are never live
        when they need to be because no spectators
        Opening ceremonies were "live" at 7e/6c"
    only on NBC TV
        "Log in with your cable provider"
    select programs on nbcolympics.com
        program videos lumped together; bad titles, no search
        searched for "serbia basketball" and top result was Rio 2016
    This is a good thing.  Who needs to watch the Olympics anyway
        corruption, wokeness, death of nationalism
        US womens basketball team kneels (so did the men's)

SF to bring woke congestion pricing
    https://www.sfchronicle.com/sf/article/S-F-is-considering-downtown-congestion-16336449.php
    https://www.sfcta.org/downtown
    Problem: Record level of congestion in 2019
        max() function always produces a "record"
    downtown zone
        north of Division, east of van Ness
    "Drivers would pay a fee to cross into this boundary during rush hours"
        ^^^ THIS will require tracking people
        6-9am, 3:30-6:30pm
        Base fee of $6.50 for $100k+; free for $46k and below
        per-trip fee for Uber/Lyft (more tracking?)
    "Making Sure Pricing Programs Are Fair"
        "Inequities have long been ingrained in our transportation system and are still present today. More cars 
            on the road disproportionately affect low-income communities of color because they are more likely to:"
            ride the bus
            live in areas with more collisions, 
            have health impacts from asthma or pollution
            spend a disproportionate amount of income on transportation
        "We’re looking at congestion pricing to flip this dynamic by charging a fee to drivers who can afford it and
            providing discounts and exemptions for those who can't"
            ^^^ THIS will require tracking people by identity group
        "A full exemption for the lowest-income drivers, plus different discount levels for other low- and moderate-income drivers"
            ^^ This incentivizes more driving for low-income, increasing disparaties they called out

Old white men win gender discrimination suit against J Walter Thompson
    https://www.theguardian.com/media/2021/jul/23/top-ad-men-who-feared-obliteration-win-sex-discrimination-claim
    https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/60f7fe27d3bf7f568ffe880b/Mr_C_Bayfield__vs_J._Walter_Thompson_Group_Limited.pdf
    In 2018, company published a "median gender pay gap" statistic of 45% in 2018
        Appointed a female creative director to "fix" it
            Jo Wallace, female, gay
            diversity conference called "Crisis: The Mother of All Change"
            “One thing we all agree on is that the reputation JWT once earned – as being full of white, British, privileged [men] – has to be obliterated.”
    Chas Bayfield and Dave Jenner
        both renowned creative directors.   Both over 50 males
        After conference, sent memos to HR asking if their jobs were safe (spoiler: they weren't)
        dragged into "hostile" meeting with Wallace and head of HR
            Dismissed two days later in November 2018
    Three other dismissed men settled out of court
    Judgement ruling:
        discrimination based on sex, victimisation, unfair dismissal, harassment
        but not discrimination of age, sexorientation, or race
    Judge ruled that JWT did violate the Equality Act of 2010
        which protects people based on age, race, sex, orientation

Chevy recalls 2017-2019 Bolt
    https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/23/gm-issues-second-recall-of-chevy-bolt-evs-after-vehicles-catch-fire.html
    https://www.nhtsa.gov/press-releases/consumer-alert-important-chevrolet-bolt-recall-fire-risk
    GM announced first recall in November 2020
        because five spontaneously caught fire
        "could be related to the high-voltage batteries"
        Owners asked to go to dealers who would reflash software to limit max charge to 90%
    Two Bolts that got that fix spontaneously burned in June 2021
        due to a "rare manufacturing defect"
        GM will replace defective battery modules - free to owners
    Recalling about 69k cars - 51k in US
    NHTSA urges owners to park cars outside and away from homes due to fire risk
        also to download NHTSA app, enter your car's details, and it will push a notification in case of recall
    Chevy asks customers to do:
        http://www.chevy.com/boltevrecall
        Use "Hilltop Reserve" mode (2017-2018) or "Target Charge" (2019) to max charge at 90%
        Charge vehicle after each use and avoid depleting battery below 70mi remaining range
        Continue to park cars outside
