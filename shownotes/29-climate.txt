what is science? It is not popularity

What do people agree on?

- Are humans a cause?
- Can we even fix it? Should we try?
- bad policy

"97% of scientists" - John Cook analyzed papers
- study said: there is global warming of 0.8 deg over 150yrs, and humans are more than 50% responsible
- Obama: "Ninety-seven percent of scientists agree: #climate change is real, man-made and dangerous."
- Kerry: "And let there be no doubt in anybody’s mind that the science is absolutely certain. . . 97 percent of climate scientists have confirmed that climate change is happening and that human activity is responsible. . . . . they agree that, if we continue to go down the same path that we are going down today, the world as we know it will change—and it will change dramatically for the worse."

computer models

antarctic ice sheets vs greenland
sea level rise...  where?

filter = good.  Censor = authoritarian
