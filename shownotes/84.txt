people don't want information, they want to be scared
    "Being scared gives us a sense of adventure. Because we don't have true masculinity leading communities into a story
    larger than potlucks, bingo games, and not offending people, we have a world full of people looking for meaning in

    fear gives a sense of adventure

    Ontario nurse union pushes back on healthy people wearing masks (2015)
        https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/u-1.3222702
        Nurse union went to arbitration against 30 Ontario hospitals
            Hospital policy required anyone who didn't have flu vaccine to wear unfitted surgical mask for entire flu season
        "They were basically coercing and shaming nurses into getting the influenza vaccine if they individually 
            chose not to take it. They made them all wear masks and they had little stickers on their 
            name tag that everyone knew meant 'I don't have my vaccine."
        policy made private medical info (vaccination) public
        Arbiter found that policy was "a coercive tool" to force health-care workers to get vaccinated

        - Do not walk alone
        - Be hyper-aware of your surroundings at all times â€“ pay attention!
        - Carry only items you need, and carry less cash
        - Be prepared to give up your cell phone and purse/wallet
        - Have keys already in your hand as you approach your car
        - Despite all our efforts, robberies may still occur! Do not argue or fight with the criminal. Do as they say. Your safety is most important!
        - Be a good witness. When you call 911, be prepared to answer many questions.

    "cryptographically sealed and verifiable" metadata
    "Assertions are cryptographically hashed and their hashes are gathered together into a claim. A claim is a 
        digitally signed data structure that represents a set of assertions along with one or more cryptographic hashes 
        on the data of an asset.
    They want it in cameras and smartphones, and all photo editing software to create new CAI tag with each edit
        Widespread adoption means people will become suspicious of untagged photos 
        if they can do that, can they also enforce copy/edit restrictions and other DRM?
