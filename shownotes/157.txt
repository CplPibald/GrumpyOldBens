Study: "Understanding discontinuance among California's electric vehicle owners"
    https://www.nature.com/articles/s41560-021-00814-9?error=cookies_not_supported&code=d6bce2c5-1243-4181-8353-d4cf6186c211
    UC Davis researchers Scott Hardman and Gil Tal, published in Nature Energy journal
        Five questionaire surveys
        Only read abstract; full study was paywalled
    "PEV discontinuance in California occurs at a rate of 20% for plug-in hybrid electric vehicle owners and 18% for
        battery electric vehicle owners. We show that discontinuance is related to dissatisfaction with the convenience 
        of charging, having other vehicles in the household that are less efficient, not having level 2 (240-volt) 
        charging at home, having fewer household vehicles and not being male."

    Provo Craft and Novelty Inc for as low as $180
    Home crafters used it to cut vinyl for custom T-shirts, personalized water bottles
    The way the machine works: You create a design on their website, then the machine downloads instructions how to print it
    When purchased, they had a $10/mo subscription service for access to a library of images and designs
    In March, Cricut announced all users would be limited to 20 uploads a month without subscription
        And if you click submit more than once because the page messed up, that counts against your total
    After public outcry, Provo Craft announced anyone who purchased in 2020 or earlier would keep unlimited
    and then walked it back https://inspiration.cricut.com/a-letter-to-the-cricut-community-from-ashish-arora-cricut-ceo/
