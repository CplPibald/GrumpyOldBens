Facebook "oversight board"
    https://thenationalpulse.com/politics/facebook-oversight-board-anti-trump-foreign/
    20 people.  19 have made public anti-Trump statements.  Only five are American.  Four of those have donated to Dem party
    ex:
        A "critical race feminism researcher"
        A former member of Open Society Initiative board of directors (Soros)
        A member of Human Rights Watch (Soros)
        Director of the "Centre for Law and Policy Research" which focuses on "transgender rights, gender equality, and public health"
        Stanford law professor who testified at impeachment
        former contributors to al Jazeera, Guardian
        former aide to Kamala Harris
        former leader of Socialist Democrats party in Denmark
        Michael McConnell, prof of Constitutional Law at Stanford
            the only Republican, and the only one who hasn't written public anti-trump statements
    quotes
        "I don't trust Trump because I generally don't trust racist people"
        "The rich, pampered, prodigal, sanctimonious, incurious, white, straight sons of the powerful do pretty well 
            everywhere in the world, and they always have. But what about us? Snarky, bisexual, Jewish women who want 
            the freedom to say what we think, read what we want, and love who we do.”
        “Trump’s trill is a disgrace to the United States and an affront to the most elementary principles of the Rule of Law,”
        “I think that Donald Trump is the jewel in the crown of the far right, fascist, xenophobic, right-wing groups that exist.”
        “I wish four years of Trump could go as fast” as a billion years
Politicians vs Oversight board
    https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/l/ar-BB1gnWhT
    Ted Cruz (TX): "disgraceful" and could have dangerous ripple effects
        “For every liberal celebrating Trump’s social media ban, if the Big Tech oligarchs can muzzle the former 
            President, what’s to stop them from silencing you?”
    Marsha Blackburn (TN):
        “it’s clear that Mark Zuckerberg views himself as the arbiter of free speech.”
    Jim Jordan (OH):
        "pathetic" "it's time to break them up"
    Ken Buck (CO):
        “Facebook made an arbitrary decision based on its political preferences, and the Oversight Board, organized 
            and funded by Facebook, reaffirmed its decision"
    Frank Pallone (D-NJ):
        “Donald Trump has played a big role in helping Facebook spread disinformation, but whether he’s on the platform 
            or not, Facebook and other social media platforms with the same business model will find ways to 
            highlight divisive content to drive advertising revenues.”

Epic v. Apple opening statements 3 May 2021
    https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/05/epic-vs-apple-opening-arguments-suggest-a-bitter-battle-over-ios-future/
    Epic's lead-off opening statements: "not suing for damages" or "special deal", 
        instead "suing for change, not just itself but for all developers"
        Epic wants court to force Apple to allow ios to use non-Apple app stores, or to open sideload channels
            adopt the macos model
        Verdict could impact other stores with same model.  Sony, Nintendo
            "My preference would be that all stores were open" - Tim Sweeney
    Epic's lock-in argument
        "The more people use our stores, the more likely they are to buy additional Apple products and upgrade to the 
            latest versions. Who's going to buy a Samsung phone if they have apps, movies, etc., already purchased? 
            They now need to spend hundreds more to get to where they are today." -- Eddie Cue, 2013
        fee changed from 30% to 15% for second year later, with no change in costs
        "There's a name for businesses that set prices without regards to costs.  Monopolies."
        App store runs on > 75% profit margin on $hundreds of millions annual revenue - 2018/2019 earnings
            ("operating margin" = return on sales, or ratio of net profit to net sales)
            in other words, really low overhead and almost all profit
            Apple says "misleading" because it doesn't count capital or fixed costs like software dev
            Epic characterized this as bait and switch
        Not providing security.  From Apple's own emails
            "more like the pretty lady who greets you with a lei at the Hawaiian airport than the drug sniffing dog"
            "App Review is bringing a plastic butter knife to a gun fight"
            "Yes, sometimes they catch things, but you should regard them as little more than the equivalent of the TSA at the airport"
            "We are building fire sprinklers, but we need to also pick up a hose"
            "I'm dumbfounded with how this could be missed"
    Apple's opening statement:
        lawsuit is "just an attack on Apple's 30 percent commission that Epic does not want to pay"
        and Epic "has decided it doesn't want to pay for Apple's innovations anymore."
        "Rather than investing in innovation, Epic [is] investing in lawyers and PR... to get the benefits that Apple provides for free,"
        Apple data suggests 12 to 26% (big range) of ios users who purchased a new phone switched to a different platform
            showing there are competetive alternatives
        when ios banned fortnite, its usage on other platforms went up, showing people have alternatives
        Locking the app store was a "security decision"
            "putting [unreviewed] native third-party apps on the iPhone could compromise the phone itself."
        Because most apps are free, Apple's "effective commission" is only 8.1%
    timeline
        2008 30% on purchasing app
        2009 in-app purchases required to go through Apple
        2011 Subscriptions must also use IAP system
    Everything hinges on how the market is defined
        Epic says it's the ios market, and Apple is a monopolist
        Apple says it's the smartphone market
            also that "ios apps" is too broad, because Fortnite can't be substituted for Waze
    Roblox on the stand
        https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2021/05/07/roblox-throws-a-wrench-in-apples-case-versus-epic/
        "games" like Roblox and Minecraft are okay, even though they have in-game stores, use their own currency, etc
            so why was fortnite banned?
        Recently went public with $38B market cap
