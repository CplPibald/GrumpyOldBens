India threatens to block Twitter over farmer protests
    India is having farmer protests
        https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/02/05/indias-farm-protests-turned-violent-last-week-why-are-farmers-protesting-first-place/
    PM Narendra Modi 
    Rihanna and Greta weighed in
    Nearly half of Indians are in agriculture, but farms are inefficient and not competetive globally (environmental impact)
        India has long subsidized farming
    Passed three laws in September
        - Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce Ordinance = allows farmers to trade outside their state
        - Farmers Agreement Ordinance = allows farmers to enter contracts outside markets and before produce is grown
        - Essential Commodities Ordinance = removes most price controls and deregulates farm markets
        Also removed some subsidies
    Many farmers are protesting these changes.  Claim
        - private buyers will undercut fixed prices from mandis (gov't-regulated markets)
        - Corporations will take over by hoarding and become monopolies
    Protests are coordinating via Twitter

        Twitter complied for a bit, then unblocked, claiming free speech
        “Twitter seems to be following a dual standard in India,” said one official
            “Will it promote a genocide hashtag in Europe or the U.S.?”
