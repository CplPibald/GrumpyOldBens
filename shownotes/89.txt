    Oakland University in Michigan tried to enforce BioButton
        https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/a/ar-BB17DVhu
        "What to expect for Fall Semester" page mentioned students would be required to
            wear button and to document symptoms in "symptom-checking app"
        Students launched petition to make it optional.  Uni caved.
        Tyler Dixon started petition because he was going to BLM rallies. "I'm not some anti-masker"
        BioIntellisense CEO James Mault:
            "The device only remits health data back to the user and no one else has access—not a school,
            not an employer. When the platform determines that a person should not come into school or work,
            the system alerts an administrator. They are only told that a person cannot come in, but they are 
            not told why, says Mault. Of course, whoever the administrator is can make a reasonable assumption
            that a person marked as ill likely has COVID-19. Even so, only the wearer ever gets access to symptom level data."

        Oakland University Vice President for Research David Stone: 
            “If [students] cannot show their ‘cleared’ status, they cannot come to class,”
            cleared either by button or by daily health screening portal
