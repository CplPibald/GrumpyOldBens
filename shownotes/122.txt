where 2020 is almost out of warranty, and we all want refunds
wet, cloudy, dark, perfect podcasting weather
where I won't be covering this likeness of god no matter how many people demand it.

Biden team whines at Twitter for not auto-subscribing people to administration account
    https://www.wnd.com/2020/12/biden-team-complains-twitter-wont-transfer-trump-followers-new-administrations-account/
    60M People who follow @POTUS or @WhiteHouse will have to re-follow those accounts after Jan 20
    Twitter plans to decommission existing accounts, then rename @Transition46 to @WhiteHouse
    26M were transferred from Obama (who suggested it)
    "Twitter's reluctance to transfer millions of followers from the Trump administration to the Biden administration 
        unnecessarily politicizes what otherwise should be a routine transfer of communication from one administration 
        to the next" -- Cameron French, Biden 

Yet another study showing asymptomatic spread is rare and can't drive an epidemic
    https://justthenews.com/politics-policy/coronavirus/new-research-further-suggests-asymptomatic-spread-covid-19-may-be-rare#article
    published in JAMA Network open journal
    U. Florida and U. Washington researchers conducted "meta analysis" of 54 studies with 78k participants
        determined "secondary attack rate" was 18% for symptomatic cases, 0.7% for asymptomatic
Yet another study showing masks don't do shit
    https://redstate.com/nick-arama/2020/12/21/new-study-casts-doubt-on-the-effectiveness-of-mask-mandates-n298161
    Florida counties that had mask mandates had 23 cases per 100k per day
        No mandate: 22 cases /100k/day
    States with mandates had 10 more cases /100k/day
    **Note all of this is about "cases".  Deaths and hospitalizations continue to flatline.
Iowa pastors order gov Kimberly Reynolds to retract mask mandate because it demands Iowans "cover the image of God"
    https://theiowastandard.com/iowa-pastors-oppose-new-mandates-order-reynolds-to-retract-unconstitutional-oppressive-mandates-that-require-iowans-to-cover-image-of-god-with-a-mask/
    Say mandate is unconstitutional, oppressive
        Whereas, God is the sole Creator of the earth and man, being made directly in His image, is the apex of His creation; and
        Whereas, God is the ultimate and highest authority, and His laws are the highest laws; and
        Whereas, masks cover the image of God by obscuring personal identity, and violate the holy law of God by 
            restraining the healthy in place of the symptomatic sick; and
        Whereas, the Constitution of the state of Iowa and the Constitution of the United States recognize the right 
            of the people to assemble peaceably with no abridgement; and
        Whereas, the Governor has no constitutional authority to decree law to the rightful citizens of Iowa; and
        Whereas, Clergy is commissioned to preach the whole counsel of God’s Word and to be a conscience to a wicked 
            world that is often ruled by tyrants.
    Demands
        Gov retract mandates
        Legislature convene to end mandates
        Resolve to defy mandates and direct churchgoers to ignore them
            by teaching that rebellion to tyrants is obedience to God

Lockdown-induced nostalgia
    https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3678606
    Scraped data of 17 trillion spotify plays in six European countries
        Belgium, France, Italy, Spain, Sweden, UK
    "Nostalgia is considered a form of melancholy depression"
        Song is considered nostalgia if it is more than three years old at time of play
        All six countries showed increase that bucks annual trends
    Trends not accounted for by the virus.  Other explanations given:
        unemployment, negative outlook caused by lockdown which reinforced COVID panic
    "COVID incidence rate does not provide significant additional explanatory power to the model. This work shows 
        that Spotify's users react to the lockdown even when COVID incidence rate is low and the impact stays high 
        even the incidence rate has peaked, suggesting that demand for nostalgia tends to respond to the drastic 
        and lasting change caused by lockdown rather than to the fluctuations in the viral infection."

John McTiernan confirms Die Hard is a christmas movie
    https://www.dailywire.com/news/watch-director-john-mctiernan-confirms-once-and-for-all-die-hard-is-a-christmas-movie
    Wasn't intended to, but it topped the box office last week
    (appeal to authority, like Steve Wilhite with GIF)
    Poll from Hollywood Reporter showed that 86% of audiences consider it xmas
        released summer 1988
        Willis says it's a summer movie
    "My hope at Christmas this year is that you will all remember that authoritarians are low-status, angry men 
        who have gone to rich people and said, ‘If you give us power, we will make sure nobody takes your stuff.’
        “And all those things you amass with power meant to scare us, meant to shut us up so we don’t kick them to 
        the side of the road and decent people of the world get on with building a future."
