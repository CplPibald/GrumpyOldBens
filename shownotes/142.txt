    question of whether it's "necessary" care, or mental illness.  Military pays other necessary medical expenses
    ... but doesn't take people with preexisting conditions - TG as protected class
    if soldiers are gov't property, does this damage their combat effectiveness?

    https://cointelegraph.com/news/nvidia-rtx-3060-mines-ether-at-full-power-as-miners-allegedly-bypass-hash-limits
    "there's a secure handshake between the driver, the RTX 3060 silicon, and the BIOS (firmware) that prevents

Brave buys Tailcat search engine
    https://brave.com/brave-search/
    Brendan Eich, CEO, likes privacy, choice
    promises no tracking, serve users not ad companies
    "We will provide options for ad-free paid search and ad-supported search." 
    "We are working on bringing private ads to search, as weâ€™ve done for Brave user ads."
    "community-curated open ranking models" = no secret algo
    Tailcat has its own independent index
    Tried to do goggles with Cliqz engine

    Language specification for search ranking
    allows custom user-defined algos
        "only tech blogs" or "exclude top 1000 domains" or individual site search
        "product reviews wihtout commercial intent", "independent media for Syria"
    Brave won't make ranking algo transparent
        goggle allows you to modify afterward
        core algo still secret - cite intellectual property, and don't want SEO
    could be used for personal search - bring your own goggle
    "does not fix the problems of misinformation, echo-chambers, confirmation bias"
        people still have to bring their bullshit filter, and look at sources critically
        offers multiple perspectives
    details
        based on adblock+ syntax
        text file containing filters = trigger + action
            trigger on url pattern
        send goggle URI along with search, and engine will sort
            privacy: personal goggle URI could be used to fingerprint
                more client side processing?  paper leaves it open

Google announces plans to stop selling ads based on browsing history
    https://blog.google/products/ads-commerce/a-more-privacy-first-web/
Google removing 3rd party cookies from Chrome, replacing with FLoC
    https://blog.google/products/ads-commerce/2021-01-privacy-sandbox/
    firefox/edge already block 3rd party by default
    Replace with "Federated Learning of Cohorts", an interest-based tracking system
        allows sites to place you into categories, rather than as an individual
        this is the most socialist thing I've seen from them
