Reddit removes options to opt-out of digital tracking
    https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/lqtecn/update_to_user_preferences/
    posted in r/changelog, and not r/blog or r/announcements
    Aaron Swartz continues spinning in his grave
    "Simplifying personalization preferences"
        too many "confusing" choices
        "We will no longer support the option to opt out of personalization of ads based on your Reddit activity."
    "Removing Outbound Click Preference" forces all outbound links to redirect through out.reddit.com
        "we leverage only aggregated data ... we're removing this setting to reduce confusion"
        setting added 4 years ago, "to add privacy".  Now removed for "confusion"
            Excuses from post 4y ago:
                https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/49jjb7/reddit_change_click_events_on_outbound_links/d0syy0a/
                "Vote speed calculation" = predict if someone clicks a link, they're going to vote on it
                "track the impact of spammed links"
                "General stats like click to vote ratio"
    Removing all opt-out options for logged out users "to reduce confusion"
    "Reddit's commitment to user privacy isn't changing"
        true; they are still totally against it
    the confusion argument started with Apple.  "Stupid consumer, we'll tell YOU what you want."
    On behalf of power users, we weren't confused.  We didn't want to be tracked.
        top comment "Don't piss on my shoe and tell me it's raining"
            "I'll take the confusion, thank you"
    GDPR argument
        by EU law, these settings should be opt-in.  They were opt-out.  Now they're no-opt
            Also illegal to not have a way to delete this data
    old.reddit.com (desktop) and i.reddit.com (mobile) are still preferable ways to browse
        until they're removed
        Using old, I still don't get redirected to out.reddit.com.  Javascript?
    Official mobile app won't allow you to browse logged out.
        and desktop will redirect you to a login page on click into comments
Also banned explicit content from r/all
    coincidentally only a couple days after taking money from UAE
