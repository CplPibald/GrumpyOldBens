where even our medical devices are racist
from America's left coast, Alexa, enable the skills to pay the bills

FDA warning on pulse oximeter devices
    https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/safety-communications/pulse-oximeter-accuracy-and-limitations-fda-safety-communication
    used for estimating blood oxygen level
        not very accurate.  A reading of 90% could mean anywhere from 86%-94%
    "The most current scientific evidence shows that there are some accuracy differences in pulse oximeters 
        between dark and light skin pigmentation; this difference is typically small at saturations above 80% 
        and greater when saturations are less than 80%"
    "these clinical studies are not statistically powered to detect differences in accuracy between demographic groups"
    
Alexa skills are a privacy nightmare
    https://www.alexa-skill-analysis.org/
    https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-would-you-ever-trust-amazons-alexa-after-this/
    (give people warning: "Alexa, halt and catch fire")
    Researchers at Ruhr-University Bochum (Germany) and North Carolina State
        looked at 90k skills in catalog
    "A first problem is that Amazon has partially activated skills automatically since 2017. Previously,
        users had to agree to the use of each skill. Now they hardly have an overview of where the answer Alexa 
        gives them comes from and who programmed it in the first place." - Dr. Martin Degeling
    no indication where an answer comes from - A lot of overlap on keywords
    Installing is a little too easy
        Method 1: Open Alexa app on smartphone, select skill from menu and click "enable"
        Method 2: "Alexa, recommend me some skills"
        Method 3: "Alexa, enable porn sounds"
        ``There's no need to download or install skills`` according to Amazon getting started page
        "Alexa, help me get started with skills"
        "Alexa, let's play a game"  "Alexa, what's the question of the day"
        specific invocations will automatically install a skill
        when overlap, Amazon always favors first-party (obv).  How else? Rating? Pay?  No transparency
            easy to activate "wrong" skill
    - Updating is even easier!
        Skills go through v1 certification process
            After that, they can change their backend code with impunity
    - An attacker can publish skills using well-known company names
        "When a skill is published in the skill store, it also displays the developer's name. We found that developers
        can register themselves with any company name when creating their developer's account with Amazon. This 
        makes it easy for an attacker to impersonate any well-known manufacturer or service provider."
            "In an experiment, we were able to publish skills in the name of a large company."
    - Only 24% of skills have a privacy policy
        which doesn't even have to tell you what they're doing
        23% of skills don't disclose the data they collect from you
        13% of "kids" category has PP (COPPA?)
        42% of "health"
    - Amazon has a permissions API, but they found it's easy to bypass
        they found 358 skills requesting personal info without going through API
    Official Amazon response to ZDNet: "The security of our devices and services is a top priority."

Boston schools are woke

        School board voted to suspend using an admissions test for their "elite" schools
            instead now allocating spots based on disadvantaged zip code and lowest income
        Parents' group filed lawsuit
    https://www.rt.com/usa/516733-boston-schools-racial-equity/
        Advanced learning programs suspended for 4/5/6 grade
            because too many white and asians got into the program
        “There's been a lot of inequities that have been brought to the light in the pandemic that we have to address,
            There's a lot of work we have to do in the district to be anti-racist and have policies where all 
            of our students have a fair shot at an equitable and excellent education.”
