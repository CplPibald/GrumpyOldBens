where we feed the trolls, because it entertains us
where agreeing with the schools, the media, the banks, the unions, the government, the social networks,
    the retailers, the universities, and the advertisers somehow makes you counter-culture

Twitter pays $100k to WA state for violating campaign laws
    https://washingtonstatewire.com/twitter-to-pay-100000-to-washington-state-for-multiple-campaign-finance-violations/
    WA requires records of all campaign spending to be publically accessible
    complaint from 2012 until Nov 2019 when Twitter banned political ads
        Candidates reported paying $195k to twitter during that time
    Sideshow Bob already got $200k from each of Google and Facebook in Dec 2018 for the same reason
        (then sued Facebook again in April 2020)

    Brookings commentary (slanted, but not unreadable)
        https://www.brookings.edu/techstream/trumps-section-230-reform-is-repudiation-in-disguise/
    Adds carve-outs where protections do not apply
        "Bad samaritan" carveout if service provider acted purposefully
        Criminal carveout = provider had knowledge and failed to remove
            or preserve evidence for one year --- Does this make illegal not keeping logs?
        Judicial decisions = when a judgment is entered about defamatory material and provider doesn't comply
    Mechanism must be "accessible and apparent"
    New classifications of law for which there is no 230 protection
        Anti-terrorism laws, child sex abuse laws, cyber stalking laws, antitrust laws
    Clarifies that a person is a provider if you "solicit, comment upon, fund, or affirmatively and substantively 
        contributes to, modifies, or alters information provided by any person or entity"
    New "Good faith" section/definition:
        Must have publicly available TOS "that state plainly and with particularity" content moderation policy
        Must restrict access to things they say they block
        Must not restrict access on "deceptive or pretextual grounds"
        Must not restrict access to anything that "is similarly situated to material that the provider intentionally
            declines to restrict"
        Must give notice describing "with particularity" the "reasonable factual basis" for the restriction
            Unless law enforcement asks not to give notice
            or provider "reasonably" believes the material relates to terrorism

    Honorlock = test proctor program acts like malware (chrome extension?)
        - force close all other programs, incl. Zoom.  Doesn't let you reopen
        - streams webcam directly to protcors/teachers
        - edits registry

        Patent for detecting cheaters googling answers
            https://patents.google.com/patent/US9881516B1/en
            Uses test questions to generate and host SEO-fake-answers as a honeypot.  Detects a device looking for
            answers from the same IP range while the test is being proctored
            Watermarks test questions with special characters
    Respondus Lockdown Browser
        "Respondus uses facial recognition to see that there is a face in the frame in the security check before 
            the test, and also we have to show our student ID, show around our room with our camera, and record 
            ourselves talking so they know it isnâ€™t someone else who looks exactly like us taking the test by 
            monitoring our voice" -- DoctorDuck47
        Stops you mid-test if its facial recognition can't find your face
    Other computers/tablets?  Limited to one MAC address from university?
    Some colleges do force webcams, because if people see a hotel room, then they know it's a COVID case and that violates HIPAA - Kallik (uni IT)
        Chromebooks can't run lockdown browsers; so they have to loaner laptops
    Advice:
        Never admit you have a computer at college.  Force them to provide you one.

        Parents can inspect child's education records
            Right transfers to student if over 18
                If either parent claimed student as dependent on taxes
        Request a school to correct inaccurate records (can request a formal hearing if school refuses)
        Schools need written permission to release most info
            list of exceptions though: school officials, other school for transfer, audits or studies, accrediting, financial aid, law enforcement
        covers grades, behavior, schoolwork
        May disclose "directory" information: name, address, phone, date and place of birth, honors and awards, attendance
            which is enough for identity theft
            Parents may opt out of this
        medical records (some debate...  "FERPA exception" in HIPAA)
        "Health and safety exception"
    GDPR
