    Breitbart, Daily Caller, Federalist censored
        confirmed their traffic dropped
        also dailykos and dailybeast

        aka "bias"
        Guidelines instruct to give "lowest" ranking to news-related "content that contradicts well-established expert consensus"
            as determined by, eg: wikipedia (which even Larry Sanger says is "badly biased")
