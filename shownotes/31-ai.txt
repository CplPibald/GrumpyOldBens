left coast where resistance is futile
left coast where humans no longer think for ourselves; we have AI for that

sex robots that can turn down sex
 - they're selling companionship. Do you want a fucktoy or a gf?
 - fine for incels and shutins who buy a sex doll because they lack the social skills to go talk to women
 - "Sex robots should have a consent module to prevent “unwanted behavioural patterns,”"
    unwanted for whom?  Who controls the behaviors?  If I can't decide how it behaves, it's not mine.
    Does your AI serve you, or do you serve your AI?  
    Also, what if it's buggy?  hacked?
 - As a cat owner, I already have a housemate that is an emotionally manipulative resource drain that denies me sex.

hard to tell robot from human
 "In my opinion, we are several years away before we have the ability to perfect not only the
    AI portion but the remaining technology that would make it difficult to tell human from a doll/robot."
 - Yeah, he underestimates how hard it is to act human.  Even humans fail the Turing Test
 Ways of telling robots in sci-fi
   - dogs (Terminator)
   - Voight-Kampff test (blade runner) - ask your sex doll how it would react to killing a puppy
 
AI equal with human experts in medical diagnosis
 - not surprising.  Humans suck, and diagnosis is hard.
 - diagnoses based on looking at medical images
 - AI excells at database lookups.
   didn't have additional patient info for steering diagnoses
   Let's see the AI empathize, or calm a screaming kid, or even take a temperature without an impersonal machine.
 - Needs a LOT more science

World's first self-navigating AI ship to make 3,000-mile journey across Atlantic
 - "navigating" ... Not a lot of obstacles out there.  But still difficult conditions
 - Plenty of unmanned things out there.  Balloons, satellites.  In air/orbit
 - native ad for IBM?

AI fake news
 - WSJ article.  Too paywalled; didn't read.
