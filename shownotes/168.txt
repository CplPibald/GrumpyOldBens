where, after a poor autotranslation, I jumped into Halo and celebrated Frag Day
where I'm going into hiding from the crypto hit squads

Citizen
    https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/citizen-public-safety-app-pushing-surveillance-boundaries-rcna1058
    Social media neighborhood watch app to track, report, share, discuss local crime
        captures info from police blotters, scanners, reports
        Can use the app to live broadcast a crime scene
        GOOD: Neighborhood watch.  BAD: Turn neighbors into informants
    Originally went by the name "Vigilante"
        "Wants to create a network of people protecting each other"
        and report on what cops are doing - "where police and citizens can hold each other accountable"
    Recently: CEO Andrew Frame offered a $30k bounty in May to encourage vigilantes to hunt down an innocent person
        whom he thought had started a CA brush fire
        "We should catch a new bad guy EVERY DAY" - Frame told employees via Slack
    Test-piloted private security force driving around LA
    from last week's Apple announcement:
        banning "apps for reporting crimes include local law enforcement"

NY attempts to pass BTC mining moratorium
    https://www.techradar.com/news/new-york-could-ban-crypto-mining-over-environmental-concerns
    Bill cited mining operations setting up in converted coal plants
        which used to run 10 days a year for over-peak generation
        now running 365
        “A single cryptocurrency transaction uses the same amount of energy that an average American household uses in one month,”
    went viral: Mining rig in a shipping container at a TX natural gas facility powered by flared-off gas
    NY Senate version passed
        would have allowed "green" mining operations; block fossil fuel
    House failed, citing pushback from IBEW
    https://www.archpaper.com/2021/04/greenidge-power-plant-mine-bitcoin-raising-fears-of-a-climate-crash/
        "the ongoing climate crisis created by the mining of cryptocurrency ... is accelerating"

El Salvador crypto law is a scam?
    https://davidgerard.co.uk/blockchain/2021/06/11/el-salvador-passes-its-bitcoin-law-and-its-a-tether-scam/
    @genen: "The way strike makes $ is by holding value in USD... so you can have a Strike wallet with $25 of bitcoin, 
        and bitcoin will go up 10% but your wallet will still have $25"
    Strike doesn't store USD; they store tethers (USD-equivalent stablecoin)
        "There has never been a verifiable redemption of tethers for the dollars supposedly backing them."
        Can cash out USDT at a Strike-operated BTC ATM.  There are two, in El Zonte.  (None in San Salvador)
    Merchants have to accept BTC, but can convert them instantly
        gov't assumes all risk
    No way to run know-your-customer on BTC transactions
        meaning it's good for money laundering
like Tether
    https://www.singlelunch.com/2021/05/19/the-tether-ponzi-scheme/
    New York AG sued Tether for being a ponzi scheme
