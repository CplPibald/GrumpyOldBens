Edmonds storage law ("guns must be always locked up") was just struck down by Snohomish superior court
 due to state pre-emption

Tacoma tax on arms and ammo:
    even the council members advocating for this say it won’t “solve gun violence”
    it’ll raise about $30,000 a year
    small businesses say it’ll put them out of business
  not about money - will lose more in lost tax by driving companies out of business.  Pure virtue signal
  Councilmember Ryan Mello: 
    “There’s federal and state preemption in what we can and cannot do related to common sense gun reform,” Mello said at Tuesday’s meeting. “So while we watch year in and year out with federal inaction, I am very sincere and serious when I say we need to be having these conversations and take leadership at the local level.”
  State Supreme court ruled 8-1 that tax doesn't violate pre-emption, when Seattle ran gun stores out of business.
