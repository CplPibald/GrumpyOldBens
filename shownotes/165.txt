SCOTUS narrows CFAA
    https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/supreme-court-hacking-cfaa-ruling/
    Nathan Van Buren, former Georgia police sergeant 
        was taking bribes to look up DMV records
        Convicted for accessing the database, and violating CFAA (Computer fraud and abuse act)
    CFAA makes illegal "accessing a computer without authorization" or "exceeding authorized access"
        broadest reading criminalizes violating a site's terms of service
    SCOTUS ruling 
        CFAA only "covers those who obtain information from particular areas in the computer ... to which their computer access does not extend"
        Van Buren was authorized as part of his job; he just went above and beyond

JBS, world's largest meat supplier, was "hacked" by ransomware
    https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/cyberattack-hits-world-s-largest-meat-supplier-n1269191
    Very few details of hack.  systems offline, and work stopped
        "JBS notified the administration that the ransom demand came from a criminal organization, likely based in Russia." according to white house

Win10 package manager flooded
    https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/windows-10s-package-manager-flooded-with-duplicate-malformed-apps/
    Story came out on Tuesday
        Rare Encounter covered it Wed
            but ablekirby won't know we covered it too because he doesn't know GOB has Friday shows
    MSFT published a tool last week with the WinGet release that allowed automated additions to community repository
        So yeah, this was inevitable
        Oh yeah, and they opened submissions on the Friday before a 3-day weekend
    To add a package, a github PR was generated to add a manifest file to a known location
        manifests/letter/vendor/product/version/manifest.yaml
        An automated process validates the manifets file
        and "check to make sure the package complies with the Windows Package Manager polices and is not known to be malicious"
            -- runs it through virustotal
    Pull requests, as of 10hrs before show time: 
        259 open, 15,348 closed
        13,355 merged, 1994 closed without merging - usually by bot for failing validation
        though the first 12k came during beta
    Bot can't automatically validate app/vendor names
        doesn't seem to validate download URLs
        doesn't seem to do any duplicate checking
            one MSFT engr commented that it's a "feature on the backlog to detect duplicates"
    Lots of PRs that overwrite existing manifests
        even if the info is wrong
        example given in article pointed out five dozen examples
            One example given where repo went down because someone used the same name with a lower case directory letter instead of uppercase
        Lots of malformed package identifiers - is there guidance on this?
    Github issue comments
        "I am absolutely baffled how this repo doesn't link to anything about what release channels or versions 
            should be selected in the package manager, or any sort of common behavior about how some choices should be made. 
            There's nothing telling me why I should believe I can trust anything the automated pipeline has accepted into 
            the repo, or that the downloads are in any way safe. Right now, using WinGet would be at best no safer than 
            randomly grabbing installer files off popup ads and running them.
            I am not sure anything can fix this repo short of a "nuke it from orbit and start over" -- ocdtrekkie
    THIS IS A CLASSIC SUPPLY CHAIN ATTACK VECTOR
        but the most official word given by MSFT is "we automated it so that approvals wouldn't be delayed too long"
        just wait until somebody fully automates overwriting all the software with malware links
    As of Wednesday, MSFT has suspended automated merge and is adding more validation to wingetcreate
