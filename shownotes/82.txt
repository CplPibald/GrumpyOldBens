    “Nothing less than the future of the Australian media landscape is at stake.” - AU treasurer Josh Frydenberg
        "It's about a fair go for Australian news media businesses. It's about ensuring that we have increased 
        competition, increased consumer protection, and a sustainable media landscape,"
    "a study" estimated 3000 "journalism" jobs lost in 10 years in AU
