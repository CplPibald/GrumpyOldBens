    Google Safe Browsing: If Google decides a site is "unsafe", it won't let you visit
        All versions of Chrome, Android
        They do this by sending the url to google for every page you visit to check against index
        Sites can be added "in minutes", but to remove it you have to "request a malware review in Google Webmaster Tools"
            takes up to 24 hours
        "What if I don't think my site is infected"
            "Malware can hide in many places, and it can be hard even for experts to figure out if their website is infected. Our accuracy rate is very good"
            TL;DR: "you're wrong"
    Apple Safari uses Safe Browsing too
        Hashes prefix of url "information calculated from website address" to send to Google
        Previous versions of ios, google could still see IP address of request
        ios 14.5 now proxies through Apple servers
