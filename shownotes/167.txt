    https://9to5mac.com/2021/06/07/apple-updates-its-app-store-guidelines-following-ios-15-announcement/
    Verge == https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/other/a/ar-AAKNYCe
    - Apps that support account creation must support account deletion that's just as easy
    - New rules requiring that developer identities are accurate and up to date
    - Apps must "provide adequate utility" to be accepted
        "drinking games" added to list of "saturated" categories
            already incl. fortune telling, dating, fart/burp, flashlight, kama sutra
                auto-rejected unless they provide a "unique high quality experience"
    - Experience must be ios specific - No names/icons/branding of other mobile platforms
        no cross-platform apps
    - will consider customer complaints when deciding if CoC is being followed
        "strict prohibitions on manipulated reviews"
        Apple will remove apps (and developers) for "misleading marketing" outside app store
        targeting scam app problem
    - tighter restrictions on porn 
        incl. pics in hookup apps and "facilitating prostitution"
    - looser restrictions on pharmacies/cannabis dispensary apps (where legal)
    - Roblox is still not a game
        - Apple doesn't want to allow Stadia or xCloud, so the rule is every game in a collection must be individually approved
        - but Roblox is a collection...
            so Apple argued at Epic trial that Roblox isn't a game
    - "Digital gift cards" MUST go through Apple IAP and pay apple tax
        Does this count BTC wallets?

            eg: "Fanhouse" app (onlyfans, but not porn) takes 10% - and Apple now wants 30% more
