left coast where the smart speaker controls what you hear, the smart oven controls what you eat,
                 the smart fridge watches your input, the smart toilet watches your output, 
                 the smart TV tells you what to do, the smart clock tells you when to do it,
                 the smart assistant decides your life for you,
                 and the dumb consumer basks in the convenience of it all
