        Hawley wanted to know "how many accounts in the US have been subject to review and shut down through Centra"

            "You download a meme from some account/page which is known to spread propaganda/hate speech etc.
                Now you think, hey let me just share this on WhatsApp on my family groups, because why not. 
                Now Facebook can easily tag you as a user who 'believes in that propaganda' and can sell that 
                data to political parties or companies to target ads or more propaganda on you."

Steal Tesla model X with bluetooth hack
    https://www.wired.com/story/tesla-model-x-hack-bluetooth/
    Tesla uses BT for keyless entry - if your phone is near, the car unlocks
    Hack rewrites firmware of key fob via BT and gets unlock code from fob
        1) Key fob has no code signing for FW updates.  New FW to query secure enclave chip inside fob
            Interface with fob by buying used "body control module" from a Tesla
        2) Use fob secret + VIN number to generate unique unlock code
        3) Key fobs contain unique key, but it is not checked.  Can pair new key and drive away.
    Company pushes OTA updates all the time, so fix is soon
    In the past, attackers have relayed key fob attacks (eg: from inside house)
