"programmers are lazy"

Way back in the day (we always have to have a "back in the day") people would completely test their software before shipping.

Now companies ship beta software knowing they can always patch it later

Users are the testers now.

Testing is expensive

might mention MSFT laying off all the testers in Windows when they started Win10.  Maybe.  It's a bit close to home, since I was one such tester.

 - windows live writer unable to post a draft
 - Reinstalling Adobe flash
