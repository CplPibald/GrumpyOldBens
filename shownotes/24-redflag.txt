In the United States, a red flag law is a gun control law that permits police 
 or family members to petition a state court to order the removal of 
 firearms from a person who may present a danger to others or themselves.
A judge makes the determination to issue the order based on statements and actions 
 made by the gun owner in question.
Refusal to comply with the order is punishable as a criminal offense


Maryland case last year where cops stormed a home and killed Gary Willis.


If this world were sane, all red flag laws would immediately be shot down
  6th amendment = speedy and public trial by jury, right to face accuser
  5th amendment = no person shall be deprived of property without due process / just compensation
  1st amendment = speech crime
  2nd amendment = duh
  4th amendment = warrants require probable cause
  8th amendment = excessive bail (civil forfeiture)

<+oztunan> When Trump said he supported red flag laws, he said, with due process.
<SirBemrose> Yeah, and Bill Barr supports encryption backdoors that hackers can't penetrate.
<SirBemrose> I too support magic rainbows and giving everybody a leprichaun's pot of gold.  As long as we're supporting 
             things that aren't possible.
<SirBemrose> You know what a red flag law would look like if it had due process?  A criminal trial.  
             We have laws for that sort of thing already.  The very point to "red flag" laws is that they can be 
             executed without due process, because due process is too slow.


I just want people to think for themselves and take personal responsibility, instead of demanding some distant
authority do it for them. Because the inevitable next step is that they demand that same distant authority 
do my thinking for me as well.
