California abolishes accelerated math programs, in the name of equity
    https://www.theepochtimes.com/dumbing-down-public-school-math-in-the-name-of-social-justice_3822075.html
    https://www.cde.ca.gov/ci/ma/cf/index.asp
    current system allows algebra in 8th grade and calculus in 12th
    New system puts all students on a "common pathway"
    “Districts and schools must confront the structural inequities of tracking and ability grouping,”
    The framework cites statistics: 32% of Asians in accelerated math; 8% of whites, 4% of black, and 3% of Latino students.
    “Those that have been privileged by the current system must be willing to give up that privilege for more equitable schooling,” 
    Oregon too
        https://www.oregon.gov/ode/educator-resources/standards/mathematics/Pages/default.aspx
        "Our goal in Oregon is to set the table for mathematics learning in a new way-- one that invites every learner 
            to the table and helps students feel an authentic sense of belonging, purpose, and joy throughout their K-12 
            learning. Join us in reimagining how we design the system so that it serves our students and ensures that 
            students build in their inherent strengths to make sense of mathematics and apply learning to solve real 
            world problems of tomorrow. An equitable mathematics system intentionally broadens participation and 
            engagement of all students, harnessing cultural, linguistic, and mathematical competencies they bring to the classroom."
    Remember, these are the common core students from 10 years ago; never learned basic arithmetic
        no (every) child left behind
    Educators no longer accept that some students are better than others.  Least common denominator

Google wants RSS back, with Chrome follow button 
    https://blog.chromium.org/2021/05/an-experiment-in-helping-users-and-web.html
    https://wptavern.com/google-aims-to-revitalize-rss-and-recapture-users-trust-with-experimental-follow-button-in-chrome
    "We’re exploring how to simplify the experience of getting the latest and greatest from your favorite sites 
        directly in Chrome, building on the open RSS web standard. Our vision is to help people build a direct 
        connection with their favorite publishers and creators on the web."
        * We have a direct connection, Google.  And it's not through Chrome.
    They encourage sites to keep the RSS up to date
    "coming soon" to Android and Chrome
    Plug for Google IO - "hosting a meetup"
    Google owned RSS, but killed Reader in July 2013 when they launched Google plus
    TechCrunch: "Undead Again:Google brings back RSS"
        https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/undead-again-google-brings-back-rss/
    Dave Winer on Chrome RSS
        http://scripting.com/2021/05/19.html
        "The memory of Google Reader may have faded so much that Google appears ready to try again. Even the headline 
            of this TechCrunch article is disturbing. Google did so much damage to RSS, the thought of them "reviving"
            it is analogous to Exxon reviving the site of some huge oil spill, one that they didn't contribute to cleaning up."
        "browser vendors have no place trying to provide the user interface for RSS.  If Google wants to help RSS, great 
            -- here's how. Do the subscribe button, that's a good thing. But the result should be a dynamic OPML 
            subscription list, that the user can provide to any reader app they want. This way, if someday Google 
            abandons RSS again, everything can keep on ticking, more or less. Inviting users to rely on them shows 
            that they have no sense of responsibility for the trust they betrayed in the past."

Facebook is still tracking you via your phone (from the 'you don't say...' dept)
    https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2021/05/22/apple-user-warning-how-to-stop-facebook-secretly-tracking-your-iphone-ipad/
    ios 14 blocked third-party tracking for the 80+% who don't click the button
    Zak Doffman told ios to "never" allow Facebook location
    but ios still puts GPS tags into photos taken
        and facebook is now getting that from the exif
        plus "upload IP address"
        FB and insta do strip metadata, but clearly they collect it first
        There are apps to remove exif, but I could not find settings in the phone to not record it
    FB privacy policy tells you how important targeted ads are.
        they "collect and process" your data, but don't share it

Tim Cook closing testimony at Apple v. Epic's trial
    https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/22/22448139/tim-cook-epic-fortnite-trial-testimony-privacy-iap-antitrust
    Hammered on privacy and security
    "Giving users control creates risk" "people choose iOS specifically so they won’t have to make risky decisions with sensitive data"
    “We’re trying to give the customer an integrated solution of hardware, software, and services. I just don’t think you replicate that in a third party.”
    "it would be both insecure and inconvenient to let apps process payments separately"
    Apple believes they must take the choice away from users in order to make them secure
        this is why I don't use apple products
