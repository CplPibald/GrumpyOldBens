Identity

logical fallacy of stereotyping
  From Wikipedia: 
    In social psychology, a stereotype is an over-generalized belief about a particular category of people.
    Stereotypes are generalized because one assumes that the stereotype is true for each individual person in the category.
  We characterize a group with a quality.  The fallacy is assuming that characterization is an accurate property of every individual in the class

SJW and identity polticis, obviously.
Hillary's deplorable campaign

Racism is categorizing people by race and assuming properties of that group
So is sexism and other isms

Reparations

Being human is about what we say, what we think, what we *do*.
As soon as you stop talking about what people do, and start 
talking about what they *are*, you've dehumanized them.
