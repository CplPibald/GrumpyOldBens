Klobuchar calling to investigate Amazon + MGM
    https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/s/ar-AAKs1rx (Business Insider)
    Amazon running out of allies.
    Klobuchar calls for "thorough investigation"
    Josh Hawley - "sale should not go through. @amazon is already a monopoly platform that owns e-commerce, shipping, 
        grocers & the cloud. They shouldn't be permitted to buy anything else. Period."
    Klobuchar introduced a bill in Feb that makes mergers illegal if they would reduce competition "materially"
        https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-04/klobuchar-pitches-antitrust-reform-for-too-big-to-fix-mergers
        prev standard was "substantially"

    AG Karl Racine claims the company unfairly raised prices and suppressed innovation
    Third party sellers required to abide by a "Business Solutions Agreement"
        which prohibited offering goods anywhere else for cheaper than Amazon ("price parity provision")
        provision was removed March 2019, replaced with "fair pricing policy" 
            which allows Amazon to "impose sanctions" if they offer a lower price elsewhere
    House Judiciary Subcomittee report fall 2020
        Amazon coerces sellers into adhering to "most favored nation" clauses
    Amazon spokesperson: "The relief the AG seeks would force Amazon to feature higher prices to customers, oddly going against core objectives of antitrust law"

Census and differential privacy
    https://themarkup.org/ask-the-markup/2021/05/11/will-new-privacy-changes-protect-census-data-or-make-things-worse
    Problem:
        1) By law, people have to respond to census with assurance that they are not privately identifiable
        2) Also by law, dataset must be confidential - data must not be able to identify individuals (no doxing)
        A 2016 test confirmed that published 2010 statistics could be combined with commercial datasets
            reconstruct name, location, demographics
        Important because if data isn't private, people will stop responding
    Differential privacy
        Add noise (fake data) to public dataset
            "minimally impact the quality while mathematically ensuring that individuals can't be identified"
            mainly a thing in rural tracts where # of households is small
        examples
            swap characteristics of households
            Assign statistically likely defaults
            use math to find out how much - 'privacy budget' per district
        Only guaranteeing accuracy for three statistics: 
            Total population by state
            number of housing units in each census block, 
            number of group quarters facilities (dorms, nursing homes)
        Also planning to manually "post-process" data to smooth over where the statistics don't make sense
            such as negative population or fractions of people
        except...  It doesn't work
            people are still identifiable
            amplifies outliers
        Early demanstration set using WA 2010 data
            401 census blocks where entire population was over 85
            3353 where entire population was under 14 (Lord of the Flies?)
            13k blocks in Alabama with no adults
    and now states and groups are complaining the census data won't be accurate
        Alabama sued on 10 Mar to stop differential privacy
            say it will be impossible to adhere to Voting Rights Act's fair redistricting requirements
                and people will sue the state over district maps
            separate suit that illegals shouldn't be counted because AL would lose a seat
                dismissed when apportionment numbers came out and AL wasn't going to lose a seat
        also increases apparent population in rural areas - more votes for those evil Republicans
    Researchers concerned too
        Lots of academic research gets data from census: "American Community Survey microdata" datasets
    Census is racist!
        minority groups are most likely to be moved around (because there are fewer of them)
        Higher risk of "re-identification" of a minority person
        Fuzzing makes communities appear more homogenous
            if they're not high enough percent minority, they might not qualify for federal affirmative action programs
    Ultimate problem is that too much hinges on census data - and on manipulating it
