CVE-2020-13777 - vulnerability in GnuTLS
    https://anarc.at/blog/2020-06-10-gnutls-audit/
    session tickets
    Passive cleartext recovery attack in TLS 1.0 to 1.2
        attack must be active in TLS 1.3, which still doesn't have wide adoption
    Effectively turns all HTTPS back into HTTP
    "many eyes" fallacy
    Affected: Any server that uses GnuTLS (fixed in 3.6.14 released last month)
        apt, webdav, curl/wget, git, mutt, weechat, mariadb
        mandos (full disk encryption) - author replied to say only OpenPGP data
        systemd uses it
    Not affected: 
        apache, gnupg, python, nginx, openssh
    SSL/TLS history of bad vulnerabilities
        Most widely publicized was heartbleed in 2014, a buffer overrun in OpenSSL, pushed everyone to require TLS 1.2

Over 4000 databases deleted by "meow" attack
    https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-meow-attack-has-deleted-almost-4-000-unsecured-databases/
    Quick reminder to secure your databases
    Someone is wiping the data from unsecured internet-facing databases and replacing it with the text "meow"
    mostly elasticsearch and mongodb

Green energy
    Solar = max about 1kW/m2, modern panels are about 15% efficient
    Wind = about 2MW/turbine, or 500MW per sqkm max
    nuclear = each plant produces about 1GW
    hydro = Bonneville Dam about 1.2 GW
    gas = about 560Mw/plant
Windmills
    - kill about 50k birds per year, compared to 8 million from glass panes, and 4 million from cats
    - can't recycle fiberglass resin blades, but super hard to cut up
    Betz's law
LFTR = molten salt reactor
    liquid fluoride thorium reactor
    can't have a nuclear meltdown.  Controls keep it hot; If all control systems break, it just cools down.
        if it fully cools, you write off the reactor
    Problems:
        - LF is extremely corrosive.  Design flaw could lead to water pooling under reactor.  Casing cracks, and dumps
        molten salt on it, flash boils water, and throws radioactive fluorine salts all over
        - Boron gas leak
        - waste = political problem, not engineering.  There's not actually that much, and we know how to store it.
            even then, after 100 years with unlimited energy, I bet we could find something better to do with it
    Fukushima = one worker died from radiation, vs 20k died from tsunami

anti-drug company executive orders
    Supreme Court seriously improved exec orders by denying turnaround on DACA orders
    - insulin
    - drugs from Canada (Bernie)
    - pharmacy benefit managers = middlemen
