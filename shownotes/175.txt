    https://gizmodo.com/a-large-ransomware-attack-may-have-ensnared-hundreds-of-1847222405
    Kaseya VSA is a RMM = Remote Monitoring and Management tool
    MSP = Managed Service provider
        host instance of VSA and manage clients' computers
    Supply chain attack affected on-prem customers (like SolarWinds)
        fingers pointed at REvil cybercriminal gang
        "Our SaaS customers were never at-risk"
        "The attackers were able to exploit zero-day vulnerabilities in the VSA product to bypass authentication and 
            run arbitrary command execution.  This allowed the attackers to leverage the standard VSA product 
            functionality to deploy ransomware to endpoints.  There is no evidence that Kaseya’s VSA codebase has been 
            maliciously modified."
        "fewer than 60 Kaseya customers, all of which were using the VSA on-premesis product"
        "total impact thus far has been to fewer than 1500 downstream businesses"
    Patch released 8 July
        and compromise detection tool
        SaaS are patched and running

    deployed with long command line
        disables defender and reconfigures it to turn off scanning and monitoring
        replaces MsMpEng.exe
        installs fake certs
    creates regkey HKLM\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\BlackLivesMatter

PrintNightmare
    https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-34527
    https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/bgr/ar-AALOxbJ
    RCE with SYSTEM privileges
        "An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights."
    Workaround: Stop and disable print spooler in services.msc
        Or disable inbound remote printing in group policy, if you need local printing to work
    Confirm regkeys are set to 0

    Updates released out of band for Server 2016, and Win10 1607+
        all other operating systems, wait for Reboot Tuesday
    Found by researches at Sangfor
        were going to show MSFT at Black Hat along with other vulnerabilities
        MSFT fixed an unrelated print spooler bug, and Sangfor thought they had patched it...
        so they published proof of concept on github

Replication crisis
    https://ucsdnews.ucsd.edu/pressrelease/a-new-replication-crisis-research-that-is-less-likely-be-true-is-cited-more
    Study from UC San Diego to check how often papers were cited
        leading psychology, economic, and "science" journals
    Papers that fail to replicate (or cannot be replicated) are cited 153x more often
        presumably because they have "interesting" results
        this is only in other "scientific" papers - to say nothing of social media "citing"
    They also analyzed and controlled for race/gender/etc of paper authors
        no change in replicability
