    https://static.noagendasocial.com/cache/media_attachments/files/106/320/282/705/458/090/original/080189b15687b74c.jpg
    "For those wondering why some of the pages on VICE.COM might not work: we have disabled all archiving services of all of our webpages,
        this includes archive.is, waybackmachine.org, megalodon.ip, and other right-wing archivign websites.
        This will have an effect on some of the articles. We are taking a stand against Racism, Bigotry, and Islamophobia alongside
        SVD.se and NPR.org and are preventing all archiving services which are being used by right-wing activists to discredit us
        and other reputable news outlets on popular forums and sub-reddits by having archived articles, blog posts, and opinion
        pieces by respected industry experts and journalists, without giving us a chance to update, remove, or edit them before
        discrediting us and damaging our reputation as the leading millennial news source. Our articles will continue to inform
        and spread awareness on Xenophobia, Racism, Sexism, and Islamophobia promoted by the current U.S. administration and
        we will not acecpt the violence promoted by Mr. Trump and his supporters on ethical journalism."
