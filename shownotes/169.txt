Samsung SmartThings v1 hub shutting down
    https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/06/samsung-is-killing-the-first-gen-smartthings-hub-this-month/
    SmartThings was independent in 2012, bought in 2014 by Samsung
        Samsung is no longer making them
    Hub is a wifi access point for Zigbee and Z-wave devices
        low-power mesh networks
        Also killing Nvidia Shield, which connects smartthings to android TVs
    Shutting down v1 version
        offering $35 migration to v3 hub (normally $125)
        No upgrade path.  You have to unpair and re-pair each light switch, bulb, toaster, and oven
            different for each device, sometimes really complex code like unscrew 40%, flip on then off three times, etc

Colorado successfully narrows wage gap... to zero
    https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/wsj/ar-AAL93A2
    Passed Equal Pay for Equal Work Act (EPEWA)
        https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/sb19-085
        Can now sue employer for "wage discrimination" violations.
        Employer is not allowed to:
            * Seek the wage rate history of a prospective employee or requiring disclosure of wage rate as a condition of employment;
            * Rely on a prior wage rate to determine a wage rate
            * Discriminate or retaliate for: 
                - failing to disclose wage history
                - inquiring about, discussing, or disclosing wage rate
                - asserting the rights established by this act
        Burden of proof is now on employer to prove the "entire wage rate differential" is part of
            * seniority, * merit, * quality of production, * geographic location, * required travel
            * education/training/experience to the extent they are reasonably related to the work in question
    EPEWA part 2: disclosure
        https://www.huschblackwell.com/newsandinsights/updated-faqs-colorados-equal-pay-rules-for-job-posting-and-pay-transparency
        requiring company to disclose expected salary for any open positions
            Applies to any company with a "presence" in the state, and to any positions available to CO residents
        into effect 1 Jan 2021
        "An employer shall make reasonable efforts to announce, post, or otherwise make known all opportunities 
            for promotion to all current employees on the same calendar day and prior to making a promotion decision."
        "An employer shall disclose in each posting for each job opening the hourly or salary compensation, or 
            a range of the hourly or salary compensation, and a general description of all of the benefits and other 
            compensation to be offered to the hired applicant."
            -- CRS 8-5-201
        "'opportunity for promotion' is a 'vacancy' in an existing on new position that could be considered a promotion 
            for any current employee in terms of compensation, benefits, status, duties or access to further advancement.'
        basically, under EPEWA you have to announce every position in the company, and their wage range, to all employees
            rules make no distinction between internal and external positions - also announce publicly
    So, according to WSJ (which doesn't name the law)
        now companies are advertising for online openings that exclude CO
        Project mgmt director at CBRE Group (real estate):
            “This position may be performed remotely anywhere within the United States except the State of Colorado.”
        Commercial finance Sr Mgr at Johnson & Johnson:
            “Work location is flexible if approved by the Company except that position may not be performed remotely from Colorado.”
        Sales specialist at McKesson Corp (pharma):
            "job postings exclude Colorado residents"
        Scientist, account exec, tax planner at Cardinal Health:
            “This is a remote, work from home position. This role is to be filled outside of the state of Colorado.”
    Website for tracking these jobs:  coloradoexcluded.com
        down when I tried it this morning - probably because of the WSJ article

Vigilante malware
    https://news.sophos.com/en-us/2021/06/17/vigilante-antipiracy-malware/
        by Andrew Brandt at Sophos Labs
    https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/06/newly-discovered-vigilante-malware-outs-software-pirates-and-blocks-them/
        sent by SirVo
    Trojans disguised as pirated software/games and distributed on Discord and Bittorrent
        filenames like Left4Dead and Minecraft with the common piracy naming conventions
            but property sheets don't necessarily match: They look more like AVG, Bitlocker, Office tools
                easy to spot if you're looking
        files contain readme.txt with garbled and generic piracy-type messages
            and "data.dat" which is actually a jpg of a pine forest
            random ".nfo" with 1kb of garbage data then 16kb of "a racial epithet", to pad out the file size
        infected executables signed by fake code signing tool that creates a random string
            CHECK YOUR DOWNLOAD HASHES, PEOPLE
    When run, the software throws a fake error dialog and exits
        “The program can’t start because MSVCR100.dll is missing from your computer. Try reinstalling the program to fix this problem.”
            though it never even calls the DLL load API to check for the file
        Vigilante reports the filename and IP addr to attacker-controlled server: 
            1flchier.com - which has been shut down
        then it tries to modify hosts file to block thepiratebay.com and up to 1000 other pirate sites
    No persistence method - to clean, edit your hosts file back and don't run the infected exe again
