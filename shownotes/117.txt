Wickliffe, OH school district's new dystopian tracking future
    https://www.news5cleveland.com/news/continuing-coverage/coronavirus/local-coronavirus-news/wickliffe-schools-using-wearable-bluetooth-devices-for-covid-19-contact-tracing
    Created by Volan Technology of NJ
    BT-enabled ID badges and fobs to track student's location within school
    "Because the system does not rely upon the GPS on a student's phone, it bypasses any potential privacy or security concerns in that regard."
    "Will [this technology] stay like how airport security stayed after 9/11? Probably. We don't want 
        to let our guard down again because there might be a future pandemic," - Michael Bettua, founder of Volan
    "There is no concern about privacy because only when the students are in the building and only when they are wearing their badge can they be tracked"
    Uses GPS to geofence within school
    Students are scored based on how well they social distance
    data stored locally
