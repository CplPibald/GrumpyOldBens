Malicious SSID can "permanently" break iphone wifi
    https://9to5mac.com/2021/06/19/a-specific-network-name-can-completely-disable-wi-fi-on-your-iphone/

    bleeping: "This week, reverse engineer Carl Schou ran into an issue when connecting to his personal WiFi hotspot"
        twitter handle @vm_call
        "reverse engineer"?
        "ran into an issue"?  Or looking for one?  You don't find this accidentally.
            More likely, he was searching for an uncontrolled format string vulnerability... and found one.
        found on iphone XS running ios 14.4.2.  BleepingComputer confirmed on ios 14.6
    After connecting (trying to connect?) to an SSID with that name, all other wifi and airdrop stops working
        problem persists after reboot
    Fix by going Settings->General->Reset->Reset Network Settings
        nukes all memory of wifi/cell/VPN networks (incl. passwords)
    %p%s%s%s%s%n
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncontrolled_format_string
        somebody fed user input into a library which gave it to a printf format string
        designed to put stack data into a string - %p pointer, %s string data at pointer, %n number of chars written so far
        All the %s probably lead to an overflow, and I guess %n causes it to go into a loop trying to count chars
        ios watchdog designed to kill processes with corrupted memory
        after reboot...  maybe it stores the last SSID it tried to access and reads that on load?
    
MassNotify app installed on android without users knowledge
    https://9to5google.com/2021/06/19/massachusetts-massnotify-app/
    https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27558500
    Massachusettes health exposure / contact tracing
        App was launched last Tuesday (isn't that about a year too late?)
        using the "Exposure Notifications Express" system that Google and Apple announced last September
        Get notification (after app is installed), which asks you to "continue", then "turn on" exposure notifications
            as well as "share analytics"
            All in Android Settings app - not a separate app
        Was installed on many phones even when people don't live in MA
            work there
            or one CT user who says they never go to MA
    Reviews from play.google.com: 629 one-star reviews
        "SPYWARE?! Automatically installed without consent. It has no icon, no way to open this and see what it 
            even does, which is a huge red flag. Per the notifications it runs on Bluetooth which is a major battery 
            drain, and seems to want to track my location"
        "This installed silently on my daughter's phone without consent or notification. She cannot have installed 
            it herself since we use Family Link and we have to approve all app installs. I have no idea how they 
            pulled this off, but it had to involve either Google, or Samsung, or both."
        "App automatically installed without my consent overnight, and there's no app icon to indicate anything 
            new was added. Lucky that Netguard caught it."
        "Reinstalled itself AFTER I uninstalled"
        "Glad to see tracking such exposure is taking advantage of technology. Too bad it's not accompanied by 
            an education effort to help people understand what this is." -- the only five-star review in the first page (100 reviews)
    Google responding to 9to5google on Saturday:
         "The company confirms the new “automatically distributed” nature but states that “COVID-19 Exposure 
            Notifications are enabled only if a user proactively turns it on.”
    App id: gov.ma.covid19.exposurenotifications
        for people who want to nuke it from the dev tools
        But it will be reinstalled if Play is running, even if auto updates is disabled
            confirmed with adb logcat
    hackernews thread
        "Remember when Tim Cook put Bono's album in the iTunes library of everybody? That's when it felt that the smartphones are not our devices"
        "It's pure madness that Play Services comes with this sort of backdoor. This is clearly what I would consider a deliberate RCE vulnerability."
           technically it's a supply chain vulnerability, which is an RCE executed by your update vendor
        one "we need it because COVID!" post:
            "It is very difficult to explain to people and all they hear is 'tracing = tracking = no privacy'."
                paraphrase: "Trust authority" even though they keep violating that trust over and over
Contact tracing was compromised from the beginning
    https://themarkup.org/privacy/2021/04/27/google-promised-its-contact-tracing-app-was-completely-private-but-it-wasnt
    *** Any pre-installed app can access the tracing log and get a list of everyone you've ever had bluetooth "contact" with
        Reported to Google in February.  No change as of April
    “This fix is a one-line thing where you remove a line that logs sensitive information to the system log"
    "When Google and Apple introduced their COVID-19 contact tracing framework in April 2020, 
        the companies aimed to reassure people worried about sharing private health information with major corporations."

SpaceX Starlink dishes overheating, shutting down

    "Dishy McFlatface"
    Arizona beta tester ("Martin") posted image to reddit
        "Offline /  Thermal shutdown / Overheated / Starlink will reconnect after cooling down"
    Dish goes into shutdown when its internal temp reaches 122F.  Reboots automatically if it goes down to 104F
        Martin got his internet back by running a sprinkler over the dish
    Common thing for Elon.  Teslas take criticism for only testing in California where temps are moderate
