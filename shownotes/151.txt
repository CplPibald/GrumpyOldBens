where is found the greatest voice in podcasting history
where I remain, as always, unFLoCed

Am I FLoCed by EFF
    https://amifloced.org/
    sent by dowodenum
    Chrome FloC trial sent out to 1 in 200 users of Chrome 89+
        Nobody has been informed, much less consented.  
        EFF tool detects if you're one
        33000 different behavior groups
    Disable third party cookies to opt out in browser
    Websites are automatically included if they access the FloC API
        or if Chrome detects that they serve ads 
            using Google "Ad Tagging", and a url list
        sites can opt out with header: Permissions-Policy: interest-cohort=()
    FLoC is application of identity ideology to browser tracking
        You're not a person anymore. You're a demographic.  It's dehumanizing.
        removes separation of context between different sites
    Makes fingerprinting much easier though - each group has "a few thousand users" according to Google
        Google has a plan to fix this called "Privacy budget" 
            where the browser starts failing API calls if it gives up more than a threshold of info
DDG browser extension promises to block FLoC

FBI 6wk cycle, this time to bomb AWS
    https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fbi-arrests-man-for-plan-to-kill-70-percent-of-internet-in-aws-bomb-attack/
    tried to buy C4 from an undercover FBI agent
        communicated over Signal
    Much more alarming that AWS is now 70% of internet
