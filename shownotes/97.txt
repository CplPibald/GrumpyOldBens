    Newsom executive order
        Sets "goals" for the state
        Directs CA Air Resources board to develop a plan
        "directs state agencies to develop strategies for an integrated, statewide rail and transit network, and 
            incorporate safe and accessible infrastructure into projects to support bicycle and pedestrian options, 
            particularly in low-income and disadvantaged communities."
        Goal to be "carbon neutral" by 2045
            "develop a plan" to close all oil extraction sites
            and ban all new fracking permits by 2024
        bypasses legislature, where it could be debated on whether it's a good idea
            “this moment demands leadership and demands movement.”
    All new passenger vehicles sold in CA must be zero-emission
        battery, and hydrogen fuel-cells okay
        Hybrids also banned

    EV Charging stations still have major gaps
        https://www.sfchronicle.com/climate/article/Californians-are-buying-up-electric-cars-But-14447810.php
        lots of places with no charging stations
        Renters with street parking - can't run cables across sidewalks
        minimal stations along interstates
            but new GavinRail should fix that!
        New stations would probably come online... if CA weren't so hostile to business
            Maybe state-run charging stations?
    PG&E can't keep the lights on - how will they do with the drain from cars?
        last week's GOB story about smart meters
        Electric car uses as much power daily as a home
        Electric and hydrogen fuel cell aren't eliminating energy usage; just shifting it to utilities...
            which can't keep up with demand amidst other environmental restrictions on "green" energy
        Banning fracking eliminates natural gas supplies to backup green power 
            so they will probably pipe in gas from other states
        End result: power costs will skyrocket
            and by the way, high energy costs disproportionately impact "low-income and disadvantaged communities"
                ... the rich can buy solar panels and electric cars for those sweet gov't incentives
