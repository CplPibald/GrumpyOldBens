    https://www.coindesk.com/mastercard-accepts-crypto-payments
    Added "Crypto Cards" in July 2020
        cards that store crypto, but convert to fiat to transfer through MC network
    This change is to MC network to make crypto native
    Eligible crypto must "tighten their compliance measures":
        provide consumer/privacy protection, "the same level of security people have come to expect in their credit cards" (what does this mean?)
        Strict compliance protocols, including Know Your Customer (aka: spy on customer and cut them off if they do something MC doesn't like)
        Must follow all local laws/regulations wherever they are used
    "To reach our network, crypto assets will need to offer the stability people need in a vehicle for spending, not investment."
