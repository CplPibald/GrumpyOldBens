    "Biggest" problem according to the media: if it works, it might shift attention away from forcing people to cut greenhouse gases
    or, it could fuck up our environment if climate change really is a hoax...

Long list of relevant studies proving masks don't work against cold and flu like respiratory illness
    https://www.rcreader.com/commentary/masks-dont-work-covid-a-review-of-science-relevant-to-covide-19-social-policy
    More than 17 studies, none show any benefit to widespread masks
    No statistically significant difference found between N95 masks and surgical masks
        a difference would be expected, if masks were proof against droplets
    Droplets of the size that transport virus particles go through masks
        and also aren't affected by gravity
    No "bias free" study exists (as of Jun 2020) showing benefit to widespread mask wearing
        in fact, there can't be, for reasons in article
    Lots of potential downsides to masks listed too
    "Second wave" completely explained by seasonal humidity fluctuations
    "minimum infective dose" discussion - can masks partially stop?
        No, because amount of virus for infection can fit into a single droplet (1k-10M range)
            even a single viron can cause infection if no antibodies
        so if there are any leaks in mask (there always are), then you can get infected anyway
            even if your mask (or sleeve) catches 99.9% of droplets
