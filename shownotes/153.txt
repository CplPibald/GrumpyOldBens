where, while other states are moving back to sanity, ours are competing to out-woke each other
where electric cargo ships are on the horizon

WA legislature votes to ban all gasoline cars starting in 2030
    https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/17/22389088
    Bans sale, purchase, or registration of any non-EV model year 2030 or later
        meaning you can't even buy out of state and register here
        "passenger and light duty vehicles" up to 10k pounds (excl emergency vehicles)
    Dependent on state approving a new tax on vehicle miles driven
        Takes effect once 3/4 of the vehicles on the road are subject to "road usage charge"

    Revise state building codes to require all buildings with on-site parking to offer EV charging stations in 10% of slots
        yeah, those won't get vandalized
    State to build a tool to optimally place where EV charging stations should go
        for use in central planning how to give out permits
        "The department, through the department's public-private partnership office and in consultation with the 
            department of ecology, the department of commerce, and the OFFICE OF EQUITY, must develop and maintain 
            a publicly available mapping and forecasting tool that provides locations and essential information 
            of charging and refueling infrastructure to support forecasted levels of electric vehicle adoption"
        Must integrate population, health, environmental, and socioeconomic data
            "to support highly impacted communities and vulnerable populations"
    Also allows for hydrogen-powered cars
        https://www.besthydrogencars.org/how-much-does-it-cost-to-refuel-a-hydrogen-car/
        Hyundai Nexo, Toyota Mirai, Honda Clarity
        400mi range, average $80 to refuel (but wildly different depending on location)
        "Gas might be cheaper, true, but in the end if you want to protect the environment, you will find that Hydrogen Cars can be a much better option."
        No hydrogen refuel stations in my county
            Bing didn't understand the search
            Google listed a couple of stations in Vancouver
            some Shell stations, but not converted yet
    reading text: it sets a "goal" that all vehicles be EV...  but
        "Nothing in this section authorizes any state agency to restrict the purchase, sale, or registration of vehicles that are not EV"
    Compare to California and Massachusettes, with bans by 2035
        CA ban is only by Newsom executive order (isn't he being recalled?)
        MA ban is part of Charlie Baker's "2050 Decarbonization Roadmap"

    (blackjack and hookers update)
        from Mike Lindell, aka "MyPillow guy" 
            who says he spent $millions on project
    Big deal about "free-speech"
        but doesn't allow swear words or blasphemy
        "You're not gonna have to worry about what you're saying or worry about being able to speak out freely, 
            but you don't get to use the four swear words. The C-word, the N-word, the F-word or God's name 
            in vain. Free speech is not pornography"
        But this isn't free speech either
    Planned a soft VIP opening on Friday and public opening today
        VIPs had to give their phone numbers
    Site isn't up yet.  VIPs never got access.
        Just a placeholder video which didn't load for me most of the morning
            occasional 405 not allowed error
