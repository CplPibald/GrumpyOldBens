For centuries, mankind has had the ability to get complex concepts across by stringing together a very small set of code points known as "letters"
 into a nearly unlimited set of concepts known as "words", which themselves can be strung into "sentences" to convey the vast breadth of human ideas.
But those times are over.  Now, the only thoughts we will be allowed to have are the ones for which there is a pre-made pictogram.
It's actually quite limiting.
Soon we will be unable to form concepts which have not already been vetted, approved, and illustrated by the UNICODE standards body.

Language
  Evolution doesn't work within a single generation.  It works when people with the old traits die off 
  and new people learn the new way.  Thisworks with language as well.  You can't "evolve" a language 
  within a decade.  When you make up new definitions, you're not "evolving" language.  You're just 
  communicating badly.
