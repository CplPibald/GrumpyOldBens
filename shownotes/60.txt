Twitter censorship

  <radix023> Bernie quit because all his campaign goals achieved.  The US economy is trashed, we have no civil liberties, 
    and people are looking to daddy government for handouts and permission to live their lives.
  "I'd rather save lives than the economy"
    if the economy collapses, people will die, you asshole
    tens of millions thrown into extreme poverty
    how many killed by...
      poverty
      homelessness
      suicide
      desperate people turning to crime, looting, hunger riots
    also, having to drive old unsafe vehicles longer,
      inability to move out of flood zones
      can't afford preventative medicine

  Serology studies suggest virus is far more widespread than thought; reduces fatality rate
    It was intellectually dishonest for people to go around citing a death rate when they really had no idea how many were infected.

  marriages collapsing, mental problems, abusive partners, alcoholism is at an all-time high, drugs.
  Imagine being stuck at home with people you cannot stand, with no job.  Or stuck at home perpetually alone.
