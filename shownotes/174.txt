where we greet the morning with the smell of stale gunpowder, used beer, and an Independence Day hangover
where I secure my used devices with a hammer

Audacity changes privacy policy
    https://github.com/audacity/audacity/issues/1213
    Audacity was "bought" by Muse Group (owners of MuseScore) in April
        Not clear what they bought - trademarks and brand
        software is GPLv2
    In May, proposed to add telemetry
        https://github.com/audacity/audacity/discussions/889
        was opt-in, and mainly included crash reports
            Lots of OSS extremists don't even want the code to exist, even if it's off
        They scrapped that plan
    Now, unilateral change to privacy policy
        looks like MuseScore privacy policy
        "Data necessary for law enforcement, litigation, and authorities' requests (if any)"
            Probably can't be included in most distros anymore (eg: debian)
        "The App we provide [Audacity] is not intended for individuals below the age of 13. If you are under 13 years old, please do not use the App."
            What are they collecting that would fall under COPPA?
            People point out this likely violates GPL
        share personal data with "our auditors, advisors, legal representatives, and similar agents"
    Forks are already in progress
        Multiple forks, each with changes already
            freeaud, Audacium, Audacious, Courage, etc

Data sticks around on used Echo devices
    https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/07/passwords-in-amazon-echo-dots-live-on-even-after-you-factory-reset-them/
    researchers from Northeastern Univ bought 86 used Echo Dots over 16 months
    61% had not been factory reset
        *still provisioned* !!
        incl. wifi passwords, router MAC
            amazon account credentials
        Alexa, who am i?
    Disassembled and forensically examined the NAND memory
        wifi credentials, physical locations
        credentials and details on other IoT devices in home (eg: door locks/cameras)
        even after factory reset
    No logs/alerts when a provisioned device is plugged in at new wifi/location/isp/etc
        It logs "activity" at new location, but those logs can be deleted by voice commands
        Control smart devices
        create orders / query package deliveries
        Use Drop-In (allows you to talk through other connected devices, eg: intercom / other alexa / doorbell)
            eg: "drop-in on kitchen"
        Alexa doesn't give owner's address, but they could find it with queries like
            what restaurants/stores/libraries are nearby?
            Use google localization API to x-ref known SSIDs (neighbors?)
    Can affect any device that leaves your house - sold or stolen
        when you're done, might be better to destroy it rather than sell used
        family member might not know to reset it
            factory reset = hold reset for 25s
                note: wifi reset = hold for 15s
        If you perform reset when not connected to wifi, it's still provisioned
            and they were able to retrieve wifi/ssid/mac info
        Resetting while on wifi does a full wipe
    they recommended Amazon encrypt the userdata partition

Comcast shutting down internet access for copyright violations

    one example
BMG vs Cox (2018) = Rightscorp
    https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/02/bmg-v-cox-isps-can-make-their-own-repeat-infringer-policies-fourth-circuit-wants
    copyright trolls - profit by identifying an IP, get ISP to give account details, then send demand letter for $$$
            also Righthaven, Prenda Law, etc
    Cox refused to forward demand letters, as they were only accusations; not proof
        lost case on internal mails that said Cox knew about "repeat offenders"
    Court ruled Cox lost its safe harbor
Sony vs Cox (2019)
    https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/06/if-not-overturned-bad-copyright-decision-will-lead-many-americans-lose-internet
        eastern PA jury found Cox responsible for
        * "willful vicarious and contributory copyright infringement"
        and enjoyed a direct financial benefit from the infringement
        Sony experts testified that Cox tolerated the allegedly infringing behavior and had the ability to terminate the accounts
        Awarded Sony $1B in damages
    US District court Liam O'Grady agreed
        cited BMG vs Cox - says Cox doesn't have safe harbor
        DMCA "contributory infringement" if ISP knew a customer infringed (NOT PROVEN) but did not take "simple measures"
            O'Grady decided that terminating account was a simple measure
        DMCA "vicarious liability" applies if you supervise the primary infringer
            O'Grady decided that being able to terminate an account is "right and ability to supervise" the person
                I don't want to be "supervised" by my ISP
    If this precedent stands the 4th circuit, ISPs will have to terminate accounts on one or two accusations
EU copyright troll case: Mircom (Cyprus) vs Telenet (Belgium)
    https://www.reuters.com/business/demands-copyright-trolls-must-be-reasonable-eus-top-court-rules-2021-06-17/
    Mircom sued Telenet for the identities of users it alleges have shared via bittorrent
        used a 3rd party to collect IP addresses
    Telenet went to Court of Justice for EU (CJEU)
    CJEU ruled that Mircom was behaving like copyright troll.  Told to stop it.
        "request for information must be non-abusive, justified and proportionate"

GETTR hacked on launch day
    https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/t/ar-AALLHVC
    created by Jason Miller - former Trump advisor
    Within 12hrs of being up, a hacker targeted high-profile accounts and changed their display names
        to "free palestine"
    Later that day, it was flooded with porn, leftist memes, Hillary nude photoshops (yuck!)
