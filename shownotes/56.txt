rights
  Column: Here's what's wrong with Gov. Newsom's stay-at-home order: It's a legal mess
    people are going to start suing.
    not a "quarantine"; that only locks down people who are infected
    "For starters, the order, like others around the country, is the most expansive, even breathtaking, assertion of government power in at least 50 years in the U.S. It directly impinges on a series of fundamental constitutional rights, including the rights of association, travel and assembly."
    Supreme court has said that for gov't to restrict rights, it must have "compelling interest" and using the "least restrictive" means
