where soon you won't even need to install a camera to spy on your neigbors
where I want need a new tractor to haul my next load of freezer beef

apologies to Lady Getoverit
    I spent 45 minutes chatting with her at a meetup
        and her hubby Hop-Scotch is responsible for about 60% of my bitcoin knowledge


802.11bf: Get the aluminum wallpaper out
    https://standards.ieee.org/project/802_11bf.html
    https://technoeager.com/wi-fi-802-11bf-the-standard-for-wi-fi-sensing/
    based on "Wi-Fi Sensing"
        uses wifi signal interference to measure people/objects that interfere with wifi signals
            presense, distance, direction, motion (speed/dir)
    application: track you through your home, turn lights on/off as you walk through a room
    At proposed 60GHz range, it can detect gestures 
        perhaps even typing (or jerking off)
    Proposal says implementations must require opt-in from users
        but wifi penetrates walls = apartment complexes?

Name:Wreck = Nine DNS vulnerabilities in four popular TCP/IP stacks (Thanks SirVo, nee dowodenum)
    https://www.forescout.com/research-labs/namewreck/
    https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1035
    https://www.wired.com/story/namewreck-iot-vulnerabilities-tcpip-millions-devices/
    DNS message compression (RFC 1035)
    vulnerable stacks: 
        FreeBSD
            Boundary error from specially crafted packet on local network triggers buffer overflow = RCE
        IPnet (used in VxWorks, OSE, INTEGRITY)
            Stack overflow in message decompression = RCE
        Nucleus.NET (used in components from Siemens)
            Does not validate length/position in decompressed responses
                write past end of string. RCE
                read past end of string = DoS
        NetX (bought by MSFT, released as OSS, now called Azure RTOS NetX)
            Does not verify forward pointer - could redirect to same location resulting in infinite loop = DoS
    All of these have patches available
        ... if your device is being patched
        Web-connected IoT devices usually aren't.

John Deere vulnerabilities allowed doxing of tractor owners

    researcher "Sick Codes" reported on Apr 13.  JD fixed both by Wednesday
    Vuln in open JD API
        1st allows list all usernames on web portal, unauthenticated
            by removing cookie from request
        Not even rate-limiting API lookups
        "I could download the data of every owner of every single John Deere tractor in the world" said to Motherboard
            Vehicle owner's name, physical addr, unique equipment ID / VIN
    Oldest vehicles were safer, because JD didn't require as much registration data.

UK legislation proposed to require device mfrs to give support end date

    Also banned from publishing default admin passwords
    part of UK Digital Security By Design project 
        "influence hardware and chip designs to enhance security"
        spawned from a 2018 report where GCHQ asks tech firms to make IoT devices secure
        "GCHQ’s Code of Practice for Consumer IoT Security contains broad-brush recommendations such as
            “implement a vulnerability disclosure policy” and “minimise exposed attack surfaces”.
