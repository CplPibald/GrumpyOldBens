    this is the most socialist thing I've seen from them
    "cohort assignment algorithm" which assigns a "cohort id" to a user based on their browsing history
    algo to assign categories to users like a tag cloud
Google Trust Token API
    https://web.dev/trust-tokens/
     "to help combat fraud and distinguish bots from real humans, without passive tracking."
    issue cryptographic tokens to a user you trust

        browser then uses it in other contexts (other sites?)
        don't contain PII
    replacement for cookies?
