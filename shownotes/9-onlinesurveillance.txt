Let's address the strawman in the room.  "I have nothing to hide"
- Do you lock your doors?  We all have a level of privacy.  In the home?  The shower?
  - Everybody poops, but we still close the bathroom door
- At best, You don't know whether you have something to hide.  
  - You aren't the one who gets to decide that.
  - Once you give them permission to decide whether you've something to hide, you also give them permission to get it wrong
  - You are breaking laws every day that you don't know about.  And laws can change.
  - EVEN IF you trust companies or the government to always have good intent, data is breached every day.
- You are assuming that the people in power share your values 
  - authoritarian in the White House
  - difference in federal vs local laws (eg: marijuana)
  - even if you're innocent, police abuse their power

  -- Edward Snowden

"A functioning police state needs no police."  -- William S. Burroughs
  
The advertising business is in to anything that lets them more effectively manipulate the public for less money.

People say "privacy", but what they want is control - and that's the last thing big data wants to give you.

"Privacy centric" is how facebook dies.  The network effect that made them what they are depends on a culture of oversharing.


Ways companies track you - in the browser
- logins
- cookies
- browser fingerprinting
- tracking "dots" - 1x1 pixels, or simply the thumbs-up button
- ping hrefs - work in chrome/safari, edge as of last year.  Disabled by default in firefox
