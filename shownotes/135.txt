    cookie banners as far as the eye could see
        companies moved to consent-management platforms (CMP)
    Researchers at MIT, Aarhus Univ (Denmark), and Univ. College London:
        scraped 10k most popular websites in UK
        11.8% of CMPs meet minimal requirements under GDPR
    Almost no enforcement, and all of the incentives are designing for sites
    GDPR:
        consent must be explicit; no "by using this site you agree..."
        "reject all tracking" must be at least as easy as accept all
            incl. browser fingerprinting
    found:
        1/3 of sites used implicit consent
        Over half have no reject all; must click an array of boxes
            many others put it on a sub-page
        only 12% make reject-all as easy as accept-all
    315 vendors = **Median** number of third-party trackers found on sites
